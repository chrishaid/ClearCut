Pennsylvania Core Standards (P C S) This Item and Scoring Sampler contains examples of test questions designed to assess the Pennsylvania Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content aligned to the PCS. The Mathematics, Reading, and Writing PSSA transitioned to PCS-based operational Mathematics and English Language Arts assessments starting with the spring 2015 PSSA administration. The P C S-aligned Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content documents are posted on this portal: • www.education.pa.gov [Hover over “Data and Reporting,” select “Assessment and Accountability,” and select “P S S A-P A System of School Assessment.” Then select “Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content” on the right side of the screen.] What Is Included This Item and Scoring Sampler contains test questions, or test “items,” that have been written to align to the Assessment Anchors that are based on the P C S. The sample test questions model the types of items that may appear on an operational P S S A. Each sample test question has been through a rigorous review process to ensure alignment with the Assessment Anchors prior to being piloted in an embedded field test within a P S S A assessment and then used operationally on a P S S A assessment. Answer keys, scoring guidelines, and any related stimulus material are also included. Additionally, sample student responses are provided with each open-ended (O E) item to demonstrate the range of responses that students provided in response to these items. PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20244PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8 Purpose and Uses The items in this Item and Scoring Sampler may be used1 as examples for creating assessment items at the classroom level. Classroom teachers may find it beneficial to have students respond to the open-ended item in this Item and Scoring Sampler. Educators may then use the Item and Scoring Sampler as a guide to score the responses either independently or together with colleagues within a school or district. This Item and Scoring Sampler also includes the General Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions that students will have access to during a P S S A mathematics administration. The general description of scoring guidelines may be distributed to students for use during local assessments and may also be used by educators when scoring local assessments. Item Format and Scoring Guidelines The multiple-choice (M C) items have four answer choices. Each correct response to an MC item is worth one point. Each O E item in mathematics is scored using an item-specific scoring guideline based on a 0–4-point scale. In this Item and Scoring Sampler, every item-specific scoring guideline is combined with examples of student responses that represent each score point to form a practical, item-specific scoring guide. Item Alignment All P S S A items are aligned to statements and specifications included in the Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content Aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards. The mathematics content, process skills, directives, and action statements included in the P S S A mathematics questions align with the Assessment Anchor Content Standards. The Eligible Content statements represent the limits of the content of the mathematics questions. 1 The permission to copy and/or use these materials does not extend to commercial purposes. 5PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8 PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 2024 Testing Time and Mode of Test Delivery for the P S S A The P S S A is delivered in a traditional paper-and-pencil format as well as in an online format. The estimated time to respond to a test question is the same for both methods of test delivery. The estimated response time for each item type is listed below. • Multiple-Choice: 2 minutes • Open-Ended: 10 to 15 minutes During an official test administration, students are given as much additional time as is necessary to complete the test questions. Mathematics Reporting Categories The Assessment Anchors are organized into four classifications as listed below. • A = Numbers and Operations • B = Algebraic Concepts • C = Geometry • D = Data Analysis and Probability These four classifications are used throughout the grade levels. In addition to these classifications, there are five Reporting Categories for each grade level. The first letter of each Reporting Category represents the classification; the second letter represents the Domain as stated in the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics. Listed below are the Reporting Categories for Grade 8. • A–N = The Number System • B–E = Expressions and Equations • B–F = Functions • C–G = Geometry • D–S = Statistics and Probability Examples of M C and O E items assessing these categories are included in this Item and Scoring Sampler. PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20246PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8 Item and Scoring Sampler Format This Item and Scoring Sampler includes the test directions and scoring guidelines that appear in the P S S A Mathematics assessments. Each MC item is followed by a table that includes the item alignment, the answer key, the depth of knowledge (D O K) level, the percentage2 of students who chose each answer option, and a brief answer-option analysis or rationale. The OE item is followed by a table that includes the item alignment, the D O K level, and the mean student score. Additionally, each of the included item-specific scoring guidelines is combined with sample student responses representing each score point to form a practical item-specific scoring guide. The General Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions used to develop the item-specific scoring guidelines should be used if any additional item-specific scoring guidelines are created for use within local instructional programs. The student responses in this Item and Scoring Sampler are actual student responses; however, the handwriting has been changed to protect the students’ identities and to make the Item and Scoring Sampler accessible to as many people as possible. Example Multiple-Choice Item Information Table Category Item-Specific Information Alignment Assigned A A E C Answer Key Correct Answer Depth of Knowledge Assigned D O K p-value A Percentage of students who selected option A p-value B Percentage of students who selected option B p-value C Percentage of students who selected option C p-value D Percentage of students who selected option D Option Annotations Brief answer-option analysis or rationale Example Open-Ended Item Information Table Category Item-Specific Information Alignment Assigned A A E C Depth of Knowledge Assigned D O K Mean Score Average Score 2 All p-value percentages listed in the item information tables have been rounded. 7PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8 PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 2024 General Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions 4 –The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the mathematical concepts and procedures required by the task. The response provides correct answer(s) with clear and complete mathematical procedures shown and a correct explanation, as required by the task.

You may use a calculator for all other questions on this test. Directions for Multiple-Choice Questions Some questions will ask you to select an answer from among four choices. For the multiple-choice questions: • First solve the problem on scratch paper. • Choose the correct answer and record your choice in the booklet. • If none of the choices matches your answer, go back and check your work for possible errors. • Only one of the answers provided is the correct response. Directions for Open-Ended Questions Some questions will require you to write your response. For the open-ended questions: • These questions have more than one part. Be sure to read the directions carefully. • You cannot receive the highest score for an open-ended question without completing all tasks in the question. For example, ◦ if the question asks you to show your work or explain your reasoning, be sure to show your work or explain your reasoning in the space provided. ◦ if the question asks you to explain, be sure to use words to explain your reasoning in the space provided. • If the question does not ask you to show your work or explain your reasoning, you may use the space provided, but only those parts of your response that the question specifically asks for will be scored. • Write your response in the appropriate location within the response box in the answer booklet. Some answers may require graphing, plotting, labeling, drawing, or shading. If you use scratch paper, be sure to transfer your final response and any needed work or reasoning to the answer booklet.

    "stem": "Both of these soy plants experienced six days of drought conditions, but the one on the right was treated with Rodriguez’s endophyte mixture. Used with permission. 5 Rodriguez has tested his endophyte mixture on crops and achieved success. In 2012 the state of Michigan was experiencing severe drought and extreme temperatures. Corn and rice seeds were coated with Rodriguez’s creation to see how they would endure such conditions. The results were overwhelmingly optimistic. Crop yields increased by 85 percent. In addition, the plants used between 25 and 50 percent less water than those not treated. Simply put, plants that had the mixture added to them were more inclined to tolerate drought than others. 6 Scientists are hopeful about the potential of endophyte fungi. Plants are easily protected from drought and other severe conditions when they are treated with this fungus. It is also a natural, nontoxic substance that does not harm plants or humans. Endophyte fungi could quite possibly be the key to providing sustainable crops for the future. Third party trademark Yellowstone® was used in these testing materials. Reading STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01 In this issue: The Cure for Concrete September 2015 Smart Discoveries in Science The Cure for Concrete 1 Bacteria have a reputation for being harmful. However, not all bacteria are bad. Some food products, such as yogurt, contain good bacteria. The human body even stores bacteria that help us produce vitamins and fight diseases. 2 Dutch microbiologist Hendrik Jonkers studies bacteria. He also has researched how certain living organisms are able to heal themselves when injured. An octopus, for example, can grow a new arm if needed. When a bone breaks in the human body, it is able to repair itself. Jonkers wondered if bacteria could be used to “heal” nonliving substances in a similar way. He tested this theory by adding bacteria to concrete. He discovered that concrete may also be able to recuperate from damage. 3 Concrete is one of the most important building materials. It was even used by the ancient Romans to build massive structures such as the Colosseum. Today it is used to construct highways, bridges, and high-rise buildings. In fact, concrete demand has doubled in the last decade. Concrete production now accounts for 5% of the world’s carbon emissions, which is harmful to the environment. The Colosseum in Rome, Italy, is almost 2,000 years old. © Nataliya Hora/Dreamstime.com 4 Despite its popularity, concrete cracks. When water gets inside the cracks, it weakens the composition of the concrete. Eventually the concrete must be repaired or replaced. In Europe the annual cost of maintaining concrete structures is billions of dollars. Reading STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01 5 Jonkers has developed a self-healing concrete, or bioconcrete, to help solve these problems. He combines concrete with bacteria that are naturally able to produce limestone, a hard rock. The bacteria are placed inside plastic capsules that are mixed into wet concrete. The bacteria can live in the hardened concrete for decades. When water enters through cracks in the concrete, the plastic capsules open, and the bacteria are released. As the bacteria grow and multiply, they form limestone, which fills in the cracks. Hendrik Jonkers with a Slab of Bioconcrete Delft University of Technology 6 In 2011 self-healing concrete was used to construct a lifeguard station near a lake in the Netherlands. Lifeguard stations are susceptible to damage by water and weather. With the help of Jonkers’ bioconcrete, the lifeguard station has remained intact. Bioconcrete has been used on the floors and roofs of parking garages. It has even been used to reconstruct a canal and irrigation system in Ecuador. 7 While bioconcrete has its advantages, it is 50 percent more costly to create than traditional concrete. This makes the product unappealing to some people in the construction industry. Still, Jonkers believes the initial investment is worth the long-term savings and advantages it will provide. 8 Bioconcrete will reduce the need for repairs and making new concrete. In return, this will help manufacturers save money over time, and it will help lessen the amount of carbon pollution. Jonkers says, “I think it’s a really nice example of tying nature and the built environments together in one new concept.” Reading STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01 Use “Persevering Plants” (pp. 11–12) to answer questions 9–13.

Suddenly they become silent, staying that way for about half an hour, forcing scientists to forage through the leaves. Reading This tiny frog measures approximately 7 millimeters. © iredding01 / Adobe Stock 4 In Papua, New Guinea, scientist C. I. Moore also recently discovered a miniature frog. At only about 6.858 millimeters, it may be even smaller than the ones Pie found. This frog’s brownish-green hue provides excellent camouflage. Moore first discovered the frog by its unique call. His team began picking up leaf litter and putting it in plastic bags until they caught sight of the new frogs. The tiny amphibians were incredibly difficult to catch because they jump like crickets. 5 In spite of the countless challenges, new tiny frogs are being found among the planet’s habitats that have previously been understudied. “That’s what’s exciting about this field,” declares Moore. “You know that new species such as these are going to continue to be discovered.” Reading Use “A Ghostly New Creature” (pp. 9–10) to answer questions 9–13.
