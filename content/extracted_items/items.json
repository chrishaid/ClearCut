The Mathematics,\nReading, and Writing PSSA transitioned to PCS-based operational Mathematics and English\nLanguage Arts assessments starting with the spring 2015 PSSA administration.\nThe P C S-aligned Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content documents are posted on this portal:\n• www.education.pa.gov [Hover over “Data and Reporting,” select “Assessment and\nAccountability,” and select “P S S A-P A System of School Assessment.” Then select\n“Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content” on the right side of the screen.]\nWhat Is Included\nThis Item and Scoring Sampler contains test questions, or test “items,” that have been written to align\nto the Assessment Anchors that are based on the P C S. The sample test questions model the types\nof items that may appear on an operational P S S A. Each sample test question has been through a\nrigorous review process to ensure alignment with the Assessment Anchors prior to being piloted in an\nembedded field test within a P S S A assessment and then used operationally on a P S S A assessment.\nAnswer keys, scoring guidelines, and any related stimulus material are also included. Additionally,\nsample student responses are provided with each open-ended (O E) item to demonstrate the range of\nresponses that students provided in response to these items.\nPSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20244PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8\nPurpose and Uses\nThe items in this Item and Scoring Sampler may be used1 as examples for creating assessment\nitems at the classroom level. Classroom teachers may find it beneficial to have students respond to\nthe open-ended item in this Item and Scoring Sampler. Educators may then use the Item and Scoring\nSampler as a guide to score the responses either independently or together with colleagues within\na school or district. This Item and Scoring Sampler also includes the General Description of Scoring\nGuidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions that students will have access to during a P S S A\nmathematics administration. The general description of scoring guidelines may be distributed to\nstudents for use during local assessments and may also be used by educators when scoring local\nassessments.\nItem Format and Scoring Guidelines\nThe multiple-choice (M C) items have four answer choices. Each correct response to an MC item is\nworth one point.\nEach O E item in mathematics is scored using an item-specific scoring guideline based on a 0–4-point\nscale. In this Item and Scoring Sampler, every item-specific scoring guideline is combined with\nexamples of student responses that represent each score point to form a practical, item-specific\nscoring guide.\nItem Alignment\nAll P S S A items are aligned to statements and specifications included in the Assessment Anchors\nand Eligible Content Aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards. The mathematics content, process\nskills, directives, and action statements included in the P S S A mathematics questions align with the\nAssessment Anchor Content Standards. The Eligible Content statements represent the limits of the\ncontent of the mathematics questions.\n1 The permission to copy and/or use these materials does not extend to commercial purposes.\n5PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8\nPSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 2024\nTesting Time and Mode of Test Delivery for the P S S A\nThe P S S A is delivered in a traditional paper-and-pencil format as well as in an online format. The\nestimated time to respond to a test question is the same for both methods of test delivery. The\nestimated response time for each item type is listed below.\n• Multiple-Choice: 2 minutes\n• Open-Ended: 10 to 15 minutes\nDuring an official test administration, students are given as much additional time as is necessary to\ncomplete the test questions.\nMathematics Reporting Categories\nThe Assessment Anchors are organized into four classifications as listed below.\n• A = Numbers and Operations\n• B = Algebraic Concepts\n• C = Geometry\n• D = Data Analysis and Probability\nThese four classifications are used throughout the grade levels. In addition to these classifications,\nthere are five Reporting Categories for each grade level. The first letter of each Reporting Category\nrepresents the classification; the second letter represents the Domain as stated in the Common Core\nState Standards for Mathematics. Listed below are the Reporting Categories for Grade 8.\n• A–N = The Number System\n• B–E = Expressions and Equations\n• B–F = Functions\n• C–G = Geometry\n• D–S = Statistics and Probability\nExamples of M C and O E items assessing these categories are included in this Item and Scoring\nSampler.\nPSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20246PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8\nItem and Scoring Sampler Format\nThis Item and Scoring Sampler includes the test directions and scoring guidelines that appear in\nthe P S S A Mathematics assessments. Each MC item is followed by a table that includes the item\nalignment, the answer key, the depth of knowledge (D O K) level, the percentage2 of students who\nchose each answer option, and a brief answer-option analysis or rationale. The OE item is followed\nby a table that includes the item alignment, the D O K level, and the mean student score. Additionally,\neach of the included item-specific scoring guidelines is combined with sample student responses\nrepresenting each score point to form a practical item-specific scoring guide. The General Description\nof Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions used to develop the item-specific\nscoring guidelines should be used if any additional item-specific scoring guidelines are created for\nuse within local instructional programs. The student responses in this Item and Scoring Sampler\nare actual student responses; however, the handwriting has been changed to protect the students’\nidentities and to make the Item and Scoring Sampler accessible to as many people as possible.\nExample Multiple-Choice Item Information Table\nCategory Item-Specific Information\nAlignment Assigned A A E C\nAnswer Key Correct Answer\nDepth of Knowledge Assigned D O K\np-value A Percentage of students who selected option A\np-value B Percentage of students who selected option B\np-value C Percentage of students who selected option C\np-value D Percentage of students who selected option D\nOption Annotations Brief answer-option analysis or rationale\nExample Open-Ended Item Information Table\nCategory Item-Specific Information\nAlignment Assigned A A E C\nDepth of Knowledge Assigned D O K\nMean Score Average Score\n2 All p-value percentages listed in the item information tables have been rounded.\n7PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8\nPSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 2024\nGeneral Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics\nOpen-Ended Questions\n4 –The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the mathematical concepts and\nprocedures required by the task.\nThe response provides correct answer(s) with clear and complete mathematical procedures\nshown and a correct explanation, as required by the task.

You may use a calculator for all other\nquestions on this test.\nDirections for Multiple-Choice Questions\nSome questions will ask you to select an answer from among four choices.\nFor the multiple-choice questions:\n• First solve the problem on scratch paper.\n• Choose the correct answer and record your choice in the booklet.\n• If none of the choices matches your answer, go back and check your work for\npossible errors.\n• Only one of the answers provided is the correct response.\nDirections for Open-Ended Questions\nSome questions will require you to write your response.\nFor the open-ended questions:\n• These questions have more than one part. Be sure to read the directions carefully.\n• You cannot receive the highest score for an open-ended question without completing all\ntasks in the question. For example,\n◦ if the question asks you to show your work or explain your reasoning, be sure to\nshow your work or explain your reasoning in the space provided.\n◦ if the question asks you to explain, be sure to use words to explain your reasoning in\nthe space provided.\n• If the question does not ask you to show your work or explain your reasoning, you\nmay use the space provided, but only those parts of your response that the question\nspecifically asks for will be scored.\n• Write your response in the appropriate location within the response box in the\nanswer booklet. Some answers may require graphing, plotting, labeling, drawing, or\nshading. If you use scratch paper, be sure to transfer your final response and any needed\nwork or reasoning to the answer booklet.\nPSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 202410PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8\nQuestion 1 in this Item and Scoring Sampler is to be solved without the use of a calculator.\nMultiple-Choice Items\n1.

In\n2012 the state of Michigan was experiencing severe drought and extreme\ntemperatures. Corn and rice seeds were coated with Rodriguez’s creation to see\nhow they would endure such conditions. The results were overwhelmingly\noptimistic. Crop yields increased by 85 percent. In addition, the plants used\nbetween 25 and 50 percent less water than those not treated. Simply put,\nplants that had the mixture added to them were more inclined to tolerate\ndrought than others.\n6 Scientists are hopeful about the potential of endophyte fungi. Plants are easily\nprotected from drought and other severe conditions when they are treated with\nthis fungus. It is also a natural, nontoxic substance that does not harm plants or\nhumans. Endophyte fungi could quite possibly be the key to providing\nsustainable crops for the future.\nThird party trademark Yellowstone® was used in these testing materials.\nReading\nPage 12STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01\nIn this issue: The Cure for Concrete September 2015\nSmart Discoveries in Science\nThe Cure for Concrete\n1 Bacteria have a reputation for being harmful. However, not all bacteria are bad.\nSome food products, such as yogurt, contain good bacteria. The human body\neven stores bacteria that help us produce vitamins and fight diseases.\n2 Dutch microbiologist Hendrik Jonkers studies bacteria. He also has researched\nhow certain living organisms are able to heal themselves when injured. An\noctopus, for example, can grow a new arm if needed. When a bone breaks in\nthe human body, it is able to repair itself. Jonkers wondered if bacteria could be\nused to “heal” nonliving substances in a similar way. He tested this theory by\nadding bacteria to concrete. He discovered that concrete may also be able to\nrecuperate from damage.\n3 Concrete is one of the most important building materials. It was even used by\nthe ancient Romans to build massive structures such as the Colosseum. Today it\nis used to construct highways, bridges, and high-rise buildings. In fact, concrete\ndemand has doubled in the last decade. Concrete production now accounts for\n5% of the world’s carbon emissions, which is harmful to the environment.\nThe Colosseum in Rome, Italy, is\nalmost 2,000 years old.\n© Nataliya Hora/Dreamstime.com\n4 Despite its popularity, concrete cracks. When water gets inside the cracks, it\nweakens the composition of the concrete. Eventually the concrete must be\nrepaired or replaced. In Europe the annual cost of maintaining concrete\nstructures is billions of dollars.\nReading\nPage 13STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01\n5 Jonkers has developed a self-healing concrete, or bioconcrete, to help solve\nthese problems. He combines concrete with bacteria that are naturally able to\nproduce limestone, a hard rock. The bacteria are placed inside plastic capsules\nthat are mixed into wet concrete. The bacteria can live in the hardened concrete\nfor decades. When water enters through cracks in the concrete, the plastic\ncapsules open, and the bacteria are released. As the bacteria grow and multiply,\nthey form limestone, which fills in the cracks.\nHendrik Jonkers with a Slab of Bioconcrete\nDelft University of Technology\n6 In 2011 self-healing concrete was used to construct a lifeguard station near a\nlake in the Netherlands. Lifeguard stations are susceptible to damage by water\nand weather. With the help of Jonkers’ bioconcrete, the lifeguard station has\nremained intact. Bioconcrete has been used on the floors and roofs of parking\ngarages. It has even been used to reconstruct a canal and irrigation system in\nEcuador.\n7 While bioconcrete has its advantages, it is 50 percent more costly to create than\ntraditional concrete. This makes the product unappealing to some people in the\nconstruction industry. Still, Jonkers believes the initial investment is worth the\nlong-term savings and advantages it will provide.\n8 Bioconcrete will reduce the need for repairs and making new concrete. In return,\nthis will help manufacturers save money over time, and it will help lessen the\namount of carbon pollution. Jonkers says, “I think it’s a really nice example of\ntying nature and the built environments together in one new concept.”\nReading\nPage 14STAAR Reading10/08/2019G8RSP19R_rev01\nUse “Persevering Plants” (pp. 11–12) to answer questions 9–13.

I. Moore also recently discovered a miniature\nfrog. At only about 6.858 millimeters, it may be even smaller than the ones Pie\nfound. This frog’s brownish-green hue provides excellent camouflage. Moore first\ndiscovered the frog by its unique call. His team began picking up leaf litter and\nputting it in plastic bags until they caught sight of the new frogs. The tiny\namphibians were incredibly difficult to catch because they jump like crickets.\n5 In spite of the countless challenges, new tiny frogs are being found among the\nplanet’s habitats that have previously been understudied. “That’s what’s exciting\nabout this field,” declares Moore. “You know that new species such as these are\ngoing to continue to be discovered.”\nReading\nPage 12\nUse “A Ghostly New Creature” (pp. 9–10) to answer questions 9–13.
