INFORMATION ABOUT MATHEMATICS
INTRODUCTION
General Introduction
The Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) provides districts and schools with tools to
assist in delivering focused instructional programs aligned with the Pennsylvania Core Standards
(PCS) These tools include Academic Standards, Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content (AAEC)
documents, assessment handbooks, and content-based item and scoring samplers This Item and
Scoring Sampler is a useful tool for Pennsylvania educators in preparing local instructional programs
by providing samples of test item types and scored student responses The item sampler is not
designed to be used as a pretest, a curriculum, or any other benchmark for operational testing
This Item and Scoring Sampler is available in Braille format For more information regarding Braille,
call (717) 901-2238
Pennsylvania Core Standards (PCS)
This sampler contains examples of test questions designed to assess the Pennsylvania Assessment
Anchors and Eligible Content aligned to the PCS The Mathematics, Reading, and Writing PSSA
transitioned to PCS-based operational Mathematics and English Language Arts assessments
starting with the spring 2015 PSSA administration
The PCS-aligned Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content documents are posted on this portal:
¾ www.education.pa.gov [Hover over “Data and Reporting,” select “Assessment and
Accountability,” and select “PSSA-PA System of School Assessment ” Then select
“Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content” on the right side of the screen ]
What Is Included
This sampler contains test questions, or test “items,” that have been written to align to the
Assessment Anchors that are based on the PCS The sample test questions model the types of
items that may appear on an operational PSSA Each sample test question has been through
a rigorous review process to ensure alignment with the Assessment Anchors prior to being
piloted in an embedded field test within a PSSA assessment and then used operationally on a
PSSA assessment Answer keys, scoring guidelines, and any related stimulus material are also
included Additionally, sample student responses are provided with each open-ended (OE) item to
demonstrate the range of responses that students provided in response to these items
PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20232INFORMATION ABOUT MATHEMATICS
Purpose and Uses
The items in this sampler may be used1 as examples for creating assessment items at the classroom
level Classroom teachers may find it beneficial to have students respond to the open-ended item
in this sampler Educators may then use the sampler as a guide to score the responses either
independently or together with colleagues within a school or district This sampler also includes
the General Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Items that students
will have access to during a PSSA mathematics administration The general description of scoring
guidelines may be distributed to students for use during local assessments and may also be used by
educators when scoring local assessments
Item Format and Scoring Guidelines
The multiple-choice (MC) items have four answer choices Each correct response to an MC item is
worth one point
Each OE item is designed to take approximately ten to fifteen minutes to complete During the
administration of the PSSA, students are given additional time as necessary to complete the test
items Each OE item in mathematics is scored using an item-specific scoring guideline based on a
0–4-point scale In this sampler, every item-specific scoring guideline is combined with examples of
student responses that represent each score point to form a practical, item-specific scoring guide
Item Alignment
All PSSA items are aligned to statements and specifications included in the Assessment Anchors
and Eligible Content Aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards. The mathematics content, process
skills, directives, and action statements included in the PSSA mathematics questions align with the
Assessment Anchor Content Standards The Eligible Content statements represent the limits of the
content of the mathematics questions

Testing Time and Mode of Testing Delivery for the PSSA
The PSSA is delivered in a traditional paper-and-pencil format as well as in an online format The
estimated time to respond to a test question is the same for both methods of test delivery The
following table shows the estimated response time for each item type
Mathematics Item Type MC OE
Estimated Response Time
(minutes) 2 10 to 15
During an official test administration, students are given as much additional time as is necessary to
complete the test questions
Mathematics Reporting Categories
The Assessment Anchors are organized into four classifications as listed below
• A = Numbers and Operations • C = Geometry
• B = Algebraic Concepts • D = Data Analysis and Probability
These four classifications are used throughout the grade levels In addition to these classifications,
there are five Reporting Categories for each grade level The first letter of each Reporting Category
represents the classification; the second letter represents the Domain as stated in the Common Core
State Standards for Mathematics Listed below are the Reporting Categories for Grade 8
• A-N = The Number System
• B-E = Expressions and Equations
• B-F = Functions
• C-G = Geometry
• D-S = Statistics and Probability
Examples of MC and OE items assessing these categories are included in this sampler

Item and Scoring Sampler Format
This sampler includes the test directions and scoring guidelines that appear in the PSSA
Mathematics assessments Each MC item is followed by a table that includes the item alignment,
the answer key, the depth of knowledge (DOK) level, the percentage2 of students who chose
each answer option, and a brief answer-option analysis or rationale The OE item is followed by a
table that includes the item alignment, the DOK level, and the mean student score Additionally,
each of the included item-specific scoring guidelines is combined with sample student responses
representing each score point to form a practical item-specific scoring guide The General
Description of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Items used to develop the item-
specific scoring guidelines should be used if any additional item-specific scoring guidelines are
created for use within local instructional programs The student responses in this item and scoring
sampler are actual student responses; however, the handwriting has been changed to protect the
students’ identities and to make the item and scoring sampler accessible to as many people as
possible

Some questions will ask you to select an answer from among four choices
For the multiple-choice questions:
• First solve the problem on scratch paper
• Choose the correct answer and record your choice in the answer booklet
• If none of the choices matches your answer, go back and check your work for
possible errors
• Only one of the answers provided is the correct response
Directions for Open-Ended Questions
Some questions will require you to write your response
For the open-ended questions:
• These questions have more than one part Be sure to read the directions carefully
• You cannot receive the highest score for an open-ended question without completing
all tasks in the question For example, if the question asks you to show your work or
explain your reasoning, be sure to show your work or explain your reasoning in the
space provided
• If the question does not ask you to show your work or explain your reasoning, you
may use the space provided, but only those parts of your response that the question
specifically asks for will be scored
• Write your response in the appropriate location within the response box in the

3, and then compares
the two rates of change
B calculates the rate of change for both functions by using the change
in x-coordinates divided by the change in y-coordinates rather than
the change in y-coordinates divided by the change in x-coordinates
(i e , uses “run over rise” rather than “rise over run”)
C uses the y-intercept of each function as the rate of change,
comparing 3 to 2
D uses the x-intercept of each function as the rate of change,
comparing – 2 to – 3, and considers – 3 to be greater since it is farther
from 0 (i e , compares the absolute values of the x-intercepts)

Option Annotations A Correct: determines that the function is increasing since the y-values
increase as the x-values increase, calculates the slope using the
change in y-coordinates divided by the change in x-coordinates,
resulting in 8 – 6_____
3 – 1 = 2__
2 = 1, and then uses the slope to determine that
the line would pass through the point (0, 5), making the y-intercept 5
B sees the negative x-values and thinks this means the function is
decreasing
C uses the x-intercept as the y-intercept and switches either the
x-values or the y-values when determining the slope
D sees the negative x-values and thinks this means the function is
decreasing, uses the x-intercept as the y-intercept, and switches
either the x-values or the y-values when determining the slope

Answers may vary Responses may be either two reflections (order does not
matter) such that the lines of reflection are perpendicular and intersect at the
origin or two dilations (order does not matter) such that the product of the
scale factors is – 1 [Note: For the PSSA, students may use the informal term
“flip” rather than “reflection”; also, the center of dilation is the origin (unless
stated otherwise), so students are not required to include the center of dilation
as part of their response.]
