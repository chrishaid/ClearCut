45 Henry made the scatterplot shown.
The scatterplot shows the data points, and it also shows the linear model that
Henry drew. Which statement best describes the linear model?
A The linear model describes the data well because points are scattered above
and below the line.
B The linear model describes the data well because all the points are close to
the line.
C The linear model does not describe the data well because the line does not
go through any of the points.
D The linear model does not describe the data well because most of the points
are located above the line.
