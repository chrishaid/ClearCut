Overview of Grade 8 English Language Arts Test
The spring 2024 grade 8 English Language Arts (ELA) test was administered in two formats: a computer-based
version and a paper-based version. Most students took the computer-based test. The paper-based test was offered as an
accommodation for eligible students who were unable to use a computer. More information can be found on the MCAS
Test Administration Resources page at www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/admin.html.
Most of the operational items on the grade 8 ELA test were the same, regardless of whether a student took the computer-
based version or the paper-based version. In places where a technology-enhanced item was used on the computer-based
test, an adapted version of the item was created for use on the paper test. These adapted paper items were multiple-choice
or multiple-select items that tested the same ELA content and assessed the same standard as the technology-enhanced
item.
The Department is not releasing items from the spring 2024 MCAS grades 3–8 tests. Released items from previous years’
computer-based tests are available on the MCAS Resource Center website at mcas.pearsonsupport.com/released-items.
Test Sessions and Content Overview
The grade 8 ELA test was made up of two separate test sessions. Each session included reading passages, followed by
selected-response questions or essay questions. On the paper-based test, the selected-response questions were multiple-
choice items and multiple-select items, in which students select the correct answer(s) from among several answer options.
Standards and Reporting Categories
The grade 8 ELA test was based on grades 6–12 learning standards in three content strands of the Massachusetts
Curriculum Framework for English Language Arts and Literacy (2017), listed below.
• Reading
• Writing
• Language
The Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for English Language Arts and Literacy is available on the Department
website at www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/current.html.
ELA test results are reported under three MCAS reporting categories, which are identical to the three framework content
strands listed above.
The tables at the conclusion of this document provide the following information about each operational item: reporting
category, standard(s) covered, item type, and item description.
Reference Materials
During both ELA test sessions, the use of authorized bilingual word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries was allowed for
students who are currently or were ever reported as English learners. No other reference materials were allowed during
any ELA test session.
