INFORMATION ABOUT MATHEMATICS
Introduction
General Introduction
The Pennsylvania Department of Education (P D E) provides districts and schools with tools to
assist in delivering focused instructional programs aligned with the Pennsylvania Core Standards
(P C S). These tools include Academic Standards, Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content (A A E C)
documents, assessment handbooks, and content-based Item and Scoring Samplers. This Item and
Scoring Sampler is a useful tool for Pennsylvania educators in preparing local instructional programs
by providing samples of test item types and scored student responses. The Item and Scoring Sampler
is not designed to be used as a pretest, a curriculum, or any other benchmark for operational testing.
This Item and Scoring Sampler is available in Braille format. For more information regarding Braille,
call (717) 901-2238.
Pennsylvania Core Standards (P C S)
This Item and Scoring Sampler contains examples of test questions designed to assess the
Pennsylvania Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content aligned to the PCS. The Mathematics,
Reading, and Writing PSSA transitioned to PCS-based operational Mathematics and English
Language Arts assessments starting with the spring 2015 PSSA administration.
The P C S-aligned Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content documents are posted on this portal:
• www.education.pa.gov [Hover over “Data and Reporting,” select “Assessment and
Accountability,” and select “P S S A-P A System of School Assessment.” Then select
“Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content” on the right side of the screen.]
What Is Included
This Item and Scoring Sampler contains test questions, or test “items,” that have been written to align
to the Assessment Anchors that are based on the P C S. The sample test questions model the types
of items that may appear on an operational P S S A. Each sample test question has been through a
rigorous review process to ensure alignment with the Assessment Anchors prior to being piloted in an
embedded field test within a P S S A assessment and then used operationally on a P S S A assessment.
Answer keys, scoring guidelines, and any related stimulus material are also included. Additionally,
sample student responses are provided with each open-ended (O E) item to demonstrate the range of
responses that students provided in response to these items.
PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 20244PSSA MATHEMATICS GRADE 8
Purpose and Uses
The items in this Item and Scoring Sampler may be used1 as examples for creating assessment
items at the classroom level. Classroom teachers may find it beneficial to have students respond to
the open-ended item in this Item and Scoring Sampler. Educators may then use the Item and Scoring
Sampler as a guide to score the responses either independently or together with colleagues within
a school or district. This Item and Scoring Sampler also includes the General Description of Scoring
Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions that students will have access to during a P S S A
mathematics administration. The general description of scoring guidelines may be distributed to
students for use during local assessments and may also be used by educators when scoring local
assessments.
Item Format and Scoring Guidelines
The multiple-choice (M C) items have four answer choices. Each correct response to an MC item is
worth one point.
Each O E item in mathematics is scored using an item-specific scoring guideline based on a 0–4-point
scale. In this Item and Scoring Sampler, every item-specific scoring guideline is combined with
examples of student responses that represent each score point to form a practical, item-specific
scoring guide.
Item Alignment
All P S S A items are aligned to statements and specifications included in the Assessment Anchors
and Eligible Content Aligned to the Pennsylvania Core Standards. The mathematics content, process
skills, directives, and action statements included in the P S S A mathematics questions align with the
Assessment Anchor Content Standards. The Eligible Content statements represent the limits of the
content of the mathematics questions.

PSSA Grade 8 Mathematics Item and Scoring Sampler—August 2024
Testing Time and Mode of Test Delivery for the P S S A
The P S S A is delivered in a traditional paper-and-pencil format as well as in an online format. The
estimated time to respond to a test question is the same for both methods of test delivery. The
estimated response time for each item type is listed below.
• Multiple-Choice: 2 minutes
• Open-Ended: 10 to 15 minutes
During an official test administration, students are given as much additional time as is necessary to
complete the test questions.
Mathematics Reporting Categories
The Assessment Anchors are organized into four classifications as listed below.
• A = Numbers and Operations
• B = Algebraic Concepts
• C = Geometry
• D = Data Analysis and Probability
These four classifications are used throughout the grade levels. In addition to these classifications,
there are five Reporting Categories for each grade level. The first letter of each Reporting Category
represents the classification; the second letter represents the Domain as stated in the Common Core
State Standards for Mathematics. Listed below are the Reporting Categories for Grade 8.
• A–N = The Number System
• B–E = Expressions and Equations
• B–F = Functions
• C–G = Geometry
• D–S = Statistics and Probability
Examples of M C and O E items assessing these categories are included in this Item and Scoring
Sampler.

Item and Scoring Sampler Format
This Item and Scoring Sampler includes the test directions and scoring guidelines that appear in
the P S S A Mathematics assessments. Each MC item is followed by a table that includes the item
alignment, the answer key, the depth of knowledge (D O K) level, the percentage2 of students who
chose each answer option, and a brief answer-option analysis or rationale. The OE item is followed
by a table that includes the item alignment, the D O K level, and the mean student score. Additionally,
each of the included item-specific scoring guidelines is combined with sample student responses
representing each score point to form a practical item-specific scoring guide. The General Description
of Scoring Guidelines for Mathematics Open-Ended Questions used to develop the item-specific
scoring guidelines should be used if any additional item-specific scoring guidelines are created for
use within local instructional programs. The student responses in this Item and Scoring Sampler
are actual student responses; however, the handwriting has been changed to protect the students’
identities and to make the Item and Scoring Sampler accessible to as many people as possible.

irrational number since 5 cannot be simplified to a rational
number because there is no whole number that when squared
equals 5
C. considers 6 to be rational by identifying 6 as a composite
number but does not recognize that the prime factors of 6 are
2 and 3 (i.e., 6 = 2 ⋅ 3), which means 6 cannot be simplified
to a rational number since the prime factors do not have even
exponents (2 and 3 have exponents of 1)

Option Annotations A. determines that the employee picked 34 pounds of
apples since the cost is $1.00 per pound of apples but
then determines that the customer picked 28.9 pounds of
apples by substituting 34.00 for n (rather than for t) into the
equation t = 0.85 n, resulting in t = 0.85(34.00) = 28.90, and
then finds the difference between the two amounts picked
(34 − 28.9 = 5.1)
B. Correct: determines that the employee picked 34 pounds
of apples since the cost is $1.00 per pound of apples,
determines that the customer picked 40 pounds of apples by
substituting 34.00 for t into the equation t = 0.85 n, resulting in
34.00 = 0.85 n, and dividing both sides of the equation by 0.85,
resulting in 40 = n, and then finds the difference between the
two amounts picked (40 − 34 = 6)
C. substitutes 34.00 for t into the equation t = 0.85 n, resulting in
34.00 = 0.85 n, and then solves the equation for n by dividing
both sides of the equation by 0.85, resulting in 40 pounds
of apples picked by the customer, but does not consider the
pounds of apples picked by the employee
D. adds the two costs, resulting in 1 + 0.85 = 1.85, and then
multiplies the sum by 34.00

8. Mr. Klavier rents out two different studio spaces to bands. The equations shown below represent
the total cost (y), in dollars, to rent each studio for x hours.
large studio: y = 80 x + 40
small studio: y = 60 x + 60
Based on the system of equations, which statement about the rental costs is correct?
A.There is no length of time at which the rental cost for the large studio is equal to the rental
cost for the small studio since the graph consists of two curves that never intersect.
B.There is no length of time at which the rental cost for the large studio is equal to the rental
cost for the small studio since the graph consists of two straight lines that never intersect.
C.There is a length of time at which the rental cost for the large studio is equal to the rental
cost for the small studio since the graph consists of two curves that intersect at two points.
D.There is a length of time at which the rental cost for the large studio is equal to the rental
cost for the small studio since the graph consists of two straight lines that intersect at a

Option Annotations A. recognizes that the equations are not equivalent because
the y-intercepts are not equal (40 ≠ 60) but thinks that each
equation can be represented by a curve rather than a line and
that the curves are “parallel” since 80 + 40 = 60 + 60
B. recognizes that each equation can be represented by a line
and that the lines are not collinear since the y-intercepts are
not equal (40 ≠ 60) but thinks that the lines are parallel since

C. thinks that each equation can be represented by a curve
rather than a line, which would make two points of intersection
possible
D. Correct: recognizes that each equation can be represented
by a line since 80 x and 60 x both represent constant rates
of change (80 and 60 are the rates of change, and the x
indicates the rate of change is constant because the exponent
for the x variable is 1) and recognizes that the lines will have

B. Correct: writes the equation for the Rodriguez family as
4 s + 2 a = 22, writes the equation for the Delgado family as
2 s + 3 a = 21, and then solves the system of two equations
either by multiplying both sides of the second equation by 2,
resulting in 4 s + 6 a = 42, subtracting the first equation from
the second equation, resulting in 4 a = 20, and then dividing
each side of the equation by 4, resulting in a = 5 OR by

Option Annotations A. Correct: recognizes that to orient trapezoid P Q R S in the same
direction as trapezoid T U V W, a rotation of 180° must occur
and that the rotation should be centered at ( )4, 4 to move
point S from ( )3, 4 to ( )5, 4 , which is the location of point W,

of trapezoid P Q R S to match the size of trapezoid T U V W, a
dilation with a scale factor of 2 must occur and that the dilation
should be centered at ( )5, 4 to keep the rotated point S on
point W, and this would result in moving the rotated point P
from ( )5, 7 to ( )5, 10 , which is the location of point T, moving

Sample Explanations:
Even though the same number of grade 7 students advanced to the second round as
grade 8 students, a grade 7 student is less likely to advance to the second round than
a grade 8 student because more grade 7 students participated in the competition than
grade 8 students.
OR
The probability a grade 7 student advanced to the second round is 44 / 77. The probability
a grade 8 student advanced to the second round is 44 / 73. Since 44 / 77 is less than 44 / 73,
a grade 7 student is less likely to advance to the second round than a grade 8 student.
OR
When comparing the probabilities, you have to use both the numerator and the
denominator. Since the numerators are the same, the probability with the larger
denominator represents a student who is less likely to advance to the second round. So a
grade 7 student is less likely to advance to the second round than a grade 8 student.

Part C: The student provided a correct and complete explanation as to why a randomly selected student likely
advanced to the second round (more kids advanced than did not advance). [1 point]
Part D: The student provided a correct and complete explanation as to why a grade 7 student is less likely to have
advanced to the second round than a grade 8 student (there was more 7th grade students who did not
advance . . . than there were 8th grade students who didn’t advance). [1 point]

PART A
Question 17
Page 1 of 4
Part A: The student provided an incorrect answer (94). No support (work or explanation) is required, so it is unclear
where an error was made. The student likely started with 150 (the total number of grade 7 and grade 8
students) and subtracted the values from the second table (150 − 20 − 24 − 12 = 94). [0 points]

PART B
Question 17
Page 2 of 4
Part B: The student provided an incorrect answer (1 / 150). No support (work or explanation) is required, so it is unclear
where an error was made. The student likely wrote the probability for 1 student out of all 150 students who
participated in the quiz competition rather than the probability for one of the 24 grade 8 female students who
advanced to the second round out of the 36 grade 8 female students who participated in the quiz competition.

Question 17
Page 4 of 4
Part D: The student provided an incorrect explanation as to why a grade 7 student is less likely to have advanced
to the second round than a grade 8 student (grade 7’s non-advanced number is close to advanced and 8th
grades isn’t). The student incorrectly attempted to associate likelihood with the difference between those who
advanced and those who did not advance. [0 points]

17. A quiz competition was held for grade 7 and grade 8 students. In the first round, each
of the 150 contestants was given a quiz. Contestants advanced to the second round if
they answered enough questions correctly. The tables below show some information
about the 150 contestants in the competition as well as some information about the
grade 8 students who competed.

Part A: The student provided an incorrect answer (9 did not advance). No support (work or explanation) is required for
Part A, so it is unclear where an error was made. The student may have looked at the first table and noted that
29 grade 8 students did not advance to the second round, looked at the second table and noted that 20 male
students advanced (rather than noting the 12 female students who did not advance), and then subtracted these
values (29 − 20 = 9). [0 points]
Part B: The student provided an incorrect answer (Their is a good probability thatsh [that she] will advance to the
second round). The student attempted to respond with a likelihood (“good probability” being similar to “more
likely”) rather than an actual probability. [0 points]

17. Continued. Please refer to the previous page for task explanation.
One of the 150 students who competed is randomly selected.
C. Explain why the randomly selected student most likely advanced to the
second round.
D. Explain why a grade 7 student is less likely to have advanced to the second
round than a grade 8 student even though the same number of grade 7
students advanced to the second round as grade 8 students.

Part C: The student provided an incorrect explanation as to why a randomly selected student likely advanced to
the second round (their is a even chance of getting it right just like their is getting it wrong). The student’s
explanation actually attempts to explain why the randomly selected student is equally likely, not most likely, to
have advanced to the second round. [0 points]
Part D: The student provided an incorrect explanation as to why a grade 7 student is less likely to have advanced
to the second round than a grade 8 student (their is less kids in the seventh grade to start with). The student
incorrectly attempted to associate likelihood with the size of the population; however, there are more, not fewer,
grade 7 students than grade 8 students who participated in the quiz competition. [0 points]
