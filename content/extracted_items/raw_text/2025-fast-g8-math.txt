Introduction
Section 1008.22(8), Florida Statutes (F.S.), requires the Department to
publish each statewide, standardized assessment administered, excluding
retakes, at least once on a triennial basis, with the initial publication
occurring after the Spring 2024 test administration. The initial publication of
assessments was required to include, at a minimum, the grade 3 Mathematics
and English Language Arts (ELA) Reading assessments, the grade 10 ELA
Reading assessment and the Algebra 1 End-of-Course (EOC) Assessment. Per
statute, released content must have appeared on tests in the administration
year immediately preceding release. Based on those requirements, below is
a proposed timeline for the release of operational tests beginning with the
2023–24 school year.

The purpose of the released tests is to promote transparency in the statewide,
standardized assessment program and to increase the comfort level of
students and parents with the state assessments. Students, parents, and
teachers should use the released tests to better understand the types of items
on Florida’s K–12 statewide assessments.
Each released test will include content that represents an operational test
blueprint for each respective assessment. The released tests can also be used
to illustrate the length of an operational test and the range of difficulties of the
questions on that test.
Each released test will include an answer key, the percentage of students
that answered that item correctly, the item’s reporting category, and the item
benchmark information.
Released tests can be accessed through the Sample Items card on the
Florida Statewide Assessments Portal.
