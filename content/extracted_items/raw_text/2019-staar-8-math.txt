18 Triangle HJK and triangle PMK are similar right triangles. The coordinates of all the vertices
are integers.
Which statement is true about the slope of HK and the slope of PK ?
F The slope of HK is less than the slope of PK , because the ratio of the change in y-values of
the endpoints to the change in x-values of the endpoints is less for HK than it is for PK .
G The slope of HK is equal to the slope of PK , because the ratio of the change in y-values of
the endpoints to the change in x-values of the endpoints is the same for HK as it is for PK .
H The slope of HK is greater than the slope of PK, because the ratio of the change in
y-values of the endpoints to the change in x-values of the endpoints is greater for HK than
it is for PK.
J The relationship between the slope of HK and the slope of PK cannot be determined,
because the triangles are congruent.
