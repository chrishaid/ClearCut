Overview of Grade 7 Mathematics Test
The spring 2024 grade 7 Mathematics test was administered in two formats: a computer-based version and a paper-based
version. Most students took the computer-based test. The paper-based test was offered as an accommodation for eligible
students who were unable to use a computer. More information can be found on the MCAS Test Administration Resources page
at www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/admin.html.
Most of the operational items on the grade 7 Mathematics test were the same, regardless of whether a student took the computer-
based version or the paper-based version. In places where a technology-enhanced item was used on the computer-based test, an
adapted version of the item was created for use on the paper test. These adapted paper items were multiple-choice, multiple-select,
or short-answer items that tested the same Mathematics content and assessed the same standard as the technology-enhanced item.
The Department is not releasing items from the spring 2024 MCAS grades 3–8 tests. Released items from previous years’
computer-based tests are available on the MCAS Resource Center website at mcas.pearsonsupport.com/released-items.
Test Sessions and Content Overview
The grade 7 Mathematics test was made up of two separate test sessions. Each session included selected-response, short-answer,
and constructed-response questions. On the paper-based test, the selected-response questions were multiple-choice items and
multiple-select items, in which students select the correct answer(s) from among several answer options.
Standards and Reporting Categories
The grade 7 Mathematics test was based on standards in the five domains for grade 7 in the Massachusetts Curriculum
Framework for Mathematics (2017). The five domains are listed below.
• Ratios and Proportional Relationships
• The Number System
• Expressions and Equations
• Geometry
• Statistics and Probability
The Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics is available on the Department website at
www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/current.html.
Mathematics test results are reported under five MCAS reporting categories, which are identical to the five framework domains
listed above.
The tables at the conclusion of this document provide the following information about each operational item: reporting
category, standard(s) covered, item type, and item description.
Reference Materials and Tools
Each student taking the grade 7 Mathematics test was provided with a ruler and a grade 7 Mathematics Reference Sheet. A copy
of the reference sheet can be found on the next page of this document.
During Session 2, each student had sole access to a calculator. Calculator use was not allowed during Session 1.
During both Mathematics test sessions, the use of authorized bilingual word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries was allowed for
students who are currently or were ever reported as English learners. No other reference tools or materials were allowed.
