Mathematics Test
Released Questions
June 2019
New York State administered the Mathematics Tests in May 2019
and is now making approximately 75% of the
questions from these tests available for review and use.
THE STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT / THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK / ALBANY, NY 12234
New York State Testing Program
Grades 3–8 Mathematics
Released Questions from 2019 Exams
Background
In 2013, New York State began administering tests designed to assess student performance in accordance with
the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P-12 Learning Standards in
Mathematics. To help in this transition to new assessments, the New York State Education Department (SED)
has been releasing an increasing number of test questions from the tests that were administered to students
across the State in the spring. This year, SED is again releasing large portions of the 2019 NYS Grades 3-8
English Language Arts and Mathematics test materials for review, discussion, and use.
For 2019, included in these released materials are at least 75 percent of the test questions that appeared on
the 2019 tests (including all constructed-response questions) that counted toward students’ scores.
Additionally, SED is also providing a map that details what each released question measures and the correct
response to each question. These released materials will help students, families, educators, and the public
better understand the tests and the New York State Education Department’s expectations for students.
Understanding Math Questions
Multiple-Choice Questions
Multiple-choice questions are designed to assess the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for
Mathematics. Mathematics multiple-choice questions will be used mainly to assess standard algorithms and
conceptual standards. Multiple-choice questions incorporate both the grade-level standards and the
“Standards for Mathematical Practices.” Many questions are framed within the context of real-world
applications or require students to complete multiple steps. Likewise, many of these questions are linked to
more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.
Short-Response Questions
Short-response questions require students to complete tasks and show their work. Like multiple-choice
questions, short-response questions will often require multiple steps, the application of multiple mathematics
skills, and real-world applications. Many of the short-response questions will cover conceptual and application
of the standards.
Extended-Response Questions
Extended-response questions ask students to show their work in completing two or more tasks or a more
extensive problem. Extended-response questions allow students to show their understanding of mathematical
procedures, conceptual understanding, and application. Extended-response questions may also assess student
reasoning and the ability to critique the arguments of others.
The scoring rubric for short and extended constructed-response questions can be found in the grade-level
Educator Guides at https://www.engageny.org/resource/test-guides-english-language-arts-andmathematics.
New York State P-12 Learning Standards Alignment
The alignment(s) to the New York State P-12 Learning Standards for Mathematics is/are intended to identify
the primary analytic skills necessary to successfully answer each question. However, some questions measure
proficiencies described in multiple standards, including a balanced combination of procedure and conceptual
understanding. For example, two-point and three-point constructed-response questions require students to
show an understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and applications.
These Released Questions Do Not Comprise a “Mini Test”
To ensure future valid and reliable tests, some content must remain secure for possible use on future exams.
As such, this document is not intended to be representative of the entire test, to show how operational tests
look, or to provide information about how teachers should administer the test; rather, its purpose is to provide
an overview of how the test reflects the demands of the New York State P-12 Learning Standards.
The released questions do not represent the full spectrum of the standards assessed on the State tests, nor do
they represent the full spectrum of how the standards should be taught and assessed in the classroom. It
should not be assumed that a particular standard will be measured by an identical question in future
assessments. Specific criteria for writing test questions, as well as additional assessment information, are
available at http://www.engageny.org/common-core-assessments.

TIPS FOR TAKING THE TEST
Here are some suggestions to help you do your best:
• Read each question carefully and think about the answer before making your choice.
• You have been provided with mathematics tools (a ruler, a protractor, and a calculator)
and a reference sheet to use during the test. It is up to you to decide when each tool and
the reference sheet will be helpful. You should use mathematics tools and the reference
sheet whenever you think they will help you to answer the question.
