The Need for High-Speed Trains
1 Urban planners believe high-speed trains are the best way to
improve urban transportation in the United States. Promoters of
high-speed transportation in the United States say that
high-speed-train travel provides several benefits that will
revolutionize our transportation system. In 2018 Florida opened the
Brightline Express. This intercity rail system is a success with
passengers. But should all U.S. cities embrace high-speed trains?
There are good reasons to answer “yes” to the high-speed-train
revolution!

Efficiency Equals Better Air Quality
2 Many researchers say the U.S. transportation system is not very
efficient or environmentally friendly. Commuters drive
single-occupant cars hundreds of miles a day. This creates a lot of
exhaust. A recent study showed that high-speed trains produce five
times less carbon dioxide than cars. That’s because high-speed
trains mostly use electricity for power. By encouraging millions of
people to use high-speed trains, air quality in a city could be
improved.
3 High-speed railways are the world’s “greenest” form of
transportation. When Californians developed the vision for their
high-speed rail system, they considered the environment. They
decided they wanted “a high-speed rail system that will deliver fast,
direct travel between the state’s major regions while providing
environmental benefits.” California has some of the most congested
Reading
Page 3
urban areas in the nation. As a result, the state’s air quality is poor.
The California High-Speed Rail Authority believes these issues could
be relieved with implementation of a high-speed rail system.
Time, Stress, and Safety
4 Using high-speed trains has other benefits too. High-speed trains
move much faster than cars. In a car it can take up to five hours to
drive round-trip from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Miami. This is
similar to the round-trip distance between the Texas cities of
San Antonio and Corpus Christi. A high-speed train takes only about
60 minutes each way. That is less than half the time it takes to get
there by car! High-speed trains provide a method of reaching far
distances in a short amount of time. Therefore, people who work far
from where they live would be able to cut their travel time
significantly. Travelers using a high-speed rail system can save
valuable time in their day.
5 Traveling on busy roads can also be stressful. Have you ever been
stuck in a car during a traffic jam at rush hour? Often, urban car
travel means dealing with stopped traffic, major delays, and
accidents. However, on a train you can read, nap, or watch the
scenery whizzing by. There’s no need to concentrate on the road
ahead.
6 Not only is train travel faster and more relaxing, it is also safer. In
fact, high-speed trains are considered to be one of the world’s safest
forms of transportation, according to international studies. Japan’s
high-speed trains have transported 10 billion passengers since they
were introduced in 1964 without a single accident! France also has a
record of safe train travel over the course of many years.
Cheap and Convenient
7 High-speed trains can help address the affordability of urban
transportation. Trains save consumers the expense of owning a car.
Cars come with many maintenance costs. People in urban settings
typically have to pay for parking as well. A person using a
high-speed train for daily travel could save thousands of dollars over
time. That person would also avoid the hassle of finding and paying
for a parking space in a crowded city. Additionally, those who are
used to driving by car would be able to spend less money on gas if
they took a high-speed train instead.
8 Even though high-speed trains would curtail car use, cars would still
be needed. Some people will have to depend on a car to get them to
and from the train station. Regardless, the amount of time saved by
Reading
Page 4
not driving to other destinations would still help people save money
and put less wear on their cars.
Local Economy Boosts
9 According to urban planners, high-speed rail systems promise to add
major real-estate development around its stations. This includes
housing as well as stores and restaurants for the many local
residents and commuters. The real-estate development will in turn
support local manufacturing and construction jobs.
10 High-speed rail systems also provide a variety of jobs. The new
technology involved in high-speed trains means more jobs in
building components of the system. There is also the job of
managing the trains and tracks. In addition, more jobs will be
available for operating the stations as well as running new
surrounding businesses.
Embracing the Change
11 Encouraging an entire nation to embrace “train culture” will
definitely be a challenge. Many people prefer having their own
method of transportation and the freedom it provides. Others are
unfamiliar with trains, and they do not know how to plan a trip or
read a train schedule. Navigating a train station can be chaotic.
However, saving time, energy, and money may help convince people
to give high-speed trains a chance.
12 Urban cities across the United States should consider a high-speed
train system. High-speed-train travel offers many benefits that cars
cannot provide. People everywhere should be “all aboard” for this
efficient and safe mode of transportation.

1 He knew he was small.
2 He just didn’t think he was small.
3 Big difference.
4 Danny had known his whole life how small he was compared to
everybody in his grade, from the first grade on. How he had been
put in the front row, front and center, of every class picture taken.
Been in the front of every line marching into every school assembly,
first one through the door. Sat in the front of every classroom. Hey,
little man. Hey, little guy. He was used to it by now. They’d been
studying DNA in science lately; being small was in his DNA. He’d
show up for soccer, or Little League baseball tryouts, or basketball,
when he’d first started going to basketball tryouts at the Y, and
there’d always be one of those clipboard dads who didn’t know him,
or his mom. Or his dad.
5 Asking him: “Are you sure you’re with the right group, little guy?”
6 Meaning the right age group.
7 It happened the first time when he was eight, back when he still had
to put the ball up on his shoulder and give it a heave just to get it
up to a ten-foot rim. When he’d already taught himself how to lean
into the bigger kid guarding him, just because there was always a
bigger kid guarding him, and then step back so he could get his
dopey shot off.
8 This was way back before he’d even tried any fancy stuff, including
the crossover.
9 He just told the clipboard dad that he was eight, that he was little,
that this was his right group, and could he have his number, please?
When he told his mom about it later, she just smiled and said, “You
know what you should hear when people start talking about your
size? Blah blah blah.”
Reading
Page 10
10 He smiled back at her and said that he was pretty sure he would be
able to remember that.
11 “How did you play?” she said that day, when she couldn’t wait any
longer for him to tell.
12 “I did okay.”
13 “I have a feeling you did more than that,” she said, hugging him to
her. “My streak of light.”
14 But here was the deal, when he added it all up: His height had
always been much more of a stinking issue for other people,
including his mom, than it was for him.
15 He tried not to sweat the small stuff, basically, the way grown-ups
always told you.
16 He knew he was faster than everybody else at St. Patrick’s School.
And at Springs School, for that matter. Nobody on either side of
town could get in front of him. He was the best passer his age, even
better than Ty Ross, who was better at everything in sports than
just about anybody. He knew that when it was just kids—which is
the way kids always liked it in sports—and the parents were out of
the gym or off the playground and you got to just play without a
whistle blowing every ten seconds or somebody yelling out more
instructions, he was always one of the first picked, because the
other guys on his team, the shooters especially, knew he’d get them
the ball.
17 Most kids, his dad told him one time, know something about
basketball that even most grown-ups never figure out.
18 One good passer changes everything.
19 Danny could pass, which is why he’d always made the team.
20 Almost always.
21 But no matter what was happening with any team he’d ever played
on, no matter how tired he would be after practice, no matter how
much homework he still had left, this driveway was still his special
place. Like a special club with a membership of one, the place where
he could come out at this time of night and imagine it up good,
imagine it big and bright, even with just the one floodlight over the
backboard and the other light, smaller, over the back door. His
mother had done everything she could to make the driveway wider
Reading
Page 11
back here, even cutting into what little backyard they had the
summer before last. “I told them you needed more room in the
corners,” she said. “The men from the paving company. They just
nodded at me, like corners were some sort of crucial thing.”
22 He had just enough room in the corners now, mostly for shooting.
He didn’t feel as if he was trying to make a drive to the basket in his
closet. Or an elevator car. He had room to maneuver, pretend he
really was at the real Garden1, that he was one of the small fast
guys who’d made it all the way there. Like Muggsy Bogues,
somebody he’d read up on when one of his coaches told him to, who
was only 5-3 and made it to the NBA. Like Tiny Archibald and Bobby
Hurley and Earl Boykins, a 5-5 guy who came out of the basketball
minor leagues, another streak of light who showed everybody that
more than size mattered, even in hoops.

10 What is the best summary of the excerpt?
F Because Danny has been the smallest student in his class since
first grade, he has been in the front of every line or row in his
classroom. During basketball tryouts Danny was asked if he was
in the right group because he was small for his age. However,
Danny is the best passer his age, and he is faster than everyone
at St. Patrick’s School.
G Although Danny has always been smaller than others in his
class, he works hard at basketball and is an excellent passer for
his age. At night he practices on the driveway, where he
imagines himself being successful. Danny has read about short
professional basketball players and hopes to play with the NBA
himself someday.
H Danny has learned about DNA in science class and thinks that
being small is in his DNA. He has taught himself how to lean into
bigger kids who guard him in basketball. Danny’s mom tells him
not to let his small size bother him.
J Danny has tried out for soccer, Little League, and basketball, but
he likes basketball best. He practices in his driveway and is the
best passer his age, even better than Ty Ross—the best athlete
in every sport. He wants to be like Muggsy Bogues someday.

Biking for Boots
1 “Emily, did you hear the terrible news about the Forest Animal
Shelter?” my cousin Shelby asked as we rode along the bike trail.
“It has to close because the building needs major repairs, but the
shelter has no funds.”
2 “Oh no—we should do something!” I exclaimed. I had adopted my
collie, Boots, from the shelter, and I instantly wanted to help.
3 “Maybe we could raise some money,” I proposed as our bikes rolled
to a stop.
4 Shelby groaned, eyeing me apprehensively. “I wanted to spend my
summer biking.”
5 “Surely there’s something we could do to support the shelter and
still have time for biking . . . a bake sale, maybe? Or a fun run!”
Suddenly I had the perfect idea.
6 “Wait! I’ve got it!” I shouted. “We could raise funds by biking
around Lake Superior—it’s the world’s largest freshwater lake! We
could ask people to pledge money for each mile we ride.”
7 “We’d have to ride over a thousand miles to bike around the lake,”
Shelby interrupted, overwhelmed, but her eyes glimmered with
anticipation too. “Let’s go ask our parents,” she agreed.
8 A month later Shelby and I left from Duluth, Minnesota, on the first
leg of our lengthy Lake Superior bicycle tour. Shelby’s mom was
going to be our support team on the road. Already we had a list of
over a hundred pledges from family and friends. We were
determined to pedal every one of the 1,300 challenging miles.
9 For the next month, our enthusiasm ebbed and flowed along with
the demands of our bicycling experiences. Once pelting rain forced
us to escape into a smelly rest stop where we waited for two hours;
another time we witnessed a bald eagle capturing a trout in the
great lake. We had flat tires to repair after riding miles of roadways.
Our energy often waned during the day, and at night our aching
muscles and insect bites kept us from sleeping peacefully at the
local motel. Yet, throughout the journey, we met many friendly
people who cheered us on and kept us motivated.

from Lake Superior to Lake Huron; we heard the thundering
Kakabeka Falls and stopped to visit the Great Lakes Shipwreck
Museum. After ten days of biking, we whooped with amazement
when we realized over 2,000 people had “liked” our posts on social
media.
11 “We’ve accumulated quite the fan club, and they’ve all donated to
the shelter.” Shelby exclaimed. “The two of us are nearly
single-handedly raising enough funds to make it possible for the
animal shelter to rebuild. That’s amazing!”
12 “Yes!” I cheered, pumping the air with my fist. I knew that despite
the challenges, the Forest Animal Shelter was a cause worth biking
for, especially if the animals there were all as sweet as Boots!

The Ride of a Lifetime!
1 People have crossed the country by bicycle, motorcycle, and even on
foot. However, one of the most astonishing treks of all time was
accomplished on horseback in 1910. It’s not the horses that made
the trip so unique, though. It’s that the horseback riders were two
tough young boys from the South. They were only nine and six
years old!
2 Bud and Temple Abernathy were born with adventure in their blood.
Their father was U.S. Marshall Jack Abernathy. His speed and skills
on horseback were phenomenal enough to catch the attention of
President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Abernathy spent time
together in Frederick, Oklahoma, in April of 1905. It was during this
visit that Roosevelt saw firsthand the outstanding horsemanship of
Jack Abernathy.

3 Jack Abernathy helped his sons plan the trip. They were to travel no
more than 50 miles a day and to carry no more than five dollars
with them at a time. They were allowed to cross creeks and rivers
but only when the water was clear enough that they could see the
bottom. They were not allowed to travel at all on Sundays.
4 Bud’s horse was named Sam Bass, and Temple rode a pony named
Geronimo. Even with a pony, six-year-old Temple was so small that
Reading
Page 18
he had to mount his horse using a tree stump or stool. The boys
took off on their 2,000-mile trip departing from Frederick,
Oklahoma. They traveled with some extra clothes, oats for their
horses, and food for themselves. They were headed to
New York City, where they would join a parade to welcome
Theodore Roosevelt home from his international travels.
5 The boys faced snowstorms, treacherous river crossings, snakes,
and scorpions on their journey. They crossed
American Indian Territory, even stopping to rest at some Indian
camps. As news of their feat spread across the countryside, families
would welcome them into their homes for a home-cooked meal and
a welcome bit of repose.

6 As Bud and Temple continued east, newspaper reporters would
congregate to meet them. The press was eager to write about their
adventure, and Americans were eager to read about it. After about
two months the boys arrived in New York City. There they joined one
million people in the welcoming parade, riding proudly down Fifth
Avenue alongside the Rough Riders, Roosevelt’s group of 1,000
volunteer soldiers, and their proud father.

Don’t Give Up on Broccoli!

1 Ever have a food that you tasted and you immediately disliked?
Maybe it was broccoli, dark chocolate, or cottage cheese. Maybe you
were “encouraged” to try the food again (and again!), and then one
of those times you actually liked it. Many people have had this
experience. While tastes are developed at a young age, they can be
altered. All it takes is a person’s desire to try something new or
unknown.
2 In 2014, researchers at the University of Birmingham released a
study that showed people have a flavor window. The flavor window
is open when an infant is four to six months old. During this time it
is easier to get babies to try a food they have not previously tasted.
The flavor window slowly closes, leaving most young children
dubious of new foods.
3 A later study, which was published in the British Journal of Nutrition,
also found that a willingness to try new foods can be learned by
infants. The researchers determined that habitually giving a baby
new foods when the flavor window is open makes the child more
likely to enjoy those foods. In addition, liking those foods makes the
infant more willing to try other new foods. This information suggests
that parents should introduce new foods to babies during this stage.
By doing so they will tend to appreciate new types of foods
throughout their lives.

4 Just because the flavor window closes at a young age doesn’t mean
it can’t be reopened. The keys to expanding the type of foods one
enjoys are persistence and exposure. A study published in
Food Quality and Preference found that if toddlers are introduced to
a new food five to 10 times, they can grow to like it. That amount
goes up as children grow older. Ultimately, the study came to the
conclusion that the flavor window may never be completely shut.
5 We learn to like or dislike flavors in three main ways. The first is
called flavor-nutrient learning. A person can form a positive
association with a flavor of a particular food and what it does for his
or her body. For example, a child eats chocolate-chip cookies, and
the sugar provides a burst of energy. The taste, combined with the
results, leads the child to enjoy the cookie and foods with similar
flavors.
6 The second way is called taste-flavor learning. This is when a person
connects a particular flavor with one they already enjoy. For
example, if you like peanut butter, spread it on a new type of bread
you are tasting for the first time. It might make all the difference in
your opinion of the bread.
7 Last, there’s social learning, meaning that people enjoy what their
families and friends enjoy. This is a lifelong learning process (it
actually starts before birth!). If, for example, a mother drinks carrot
juice while pregnant, the baby will probably enjoy carrot-flavored
cereal more than babies whose mothers did not drink carrot juice.
As children grow, this third type of learning takes place while talking
about food in social situations and tasting new foods with friends
and family.
8 People’s tastes evolve over time in similar ways. For example, adults
tend to enjoy sweets less than when they were children. They
typically enjoy vegetables more. The reasons for these are
biological. A child’s love of sugar could be related to the need to give
fuel to a growing body. Adults’ greater appreciation for vegetables,
despite bitter tastes and people’s natural aversion to bitterness,
comes from persistence. Children copy what they see adults eating
and often learn to like vegetables.

9 Being willing to try a new food repeatedly is necessary to pry a
person’s flavor window open again. Each attempt will lessen the
natural suspicion of something new. Eventually, “not bad” can turn
into “pretty good.” One method for inspiring courage to try new
foods multiple times is testing different preparations. Adding an
ingredient—sugar or salt, perhaps—that one enjoys, might make an
unappealing food more appealing. Once the person has trained him
or herself to like the food, the added ingredient may not be
necessary.
10 Overcoming a dislike of a particular food requires tasting a food in
different ways and at different times. In spite of strange smells, odd
textures, or distinctive flavors, a person has the ability to acquire a
true liking for even the most unique and unusual foods. So don’t
give up—you never know when you might surprise yourself and
discover that broccoli is your new favorite food!

Millicent Min, also known as Millie, is a genius who has skipped
many grades, which makes it difficult to make friends at school.
When Millie’s parents sign her up for volleyball at Rancho Rosetta,
she does not expect to make friends there either.
from
Millicent Min, Girl Genius
by Lisa Yee
1 Maybe I ought to just live in my tree—when I am up here, I can just
be myself, by myself. Here, I don’t have to contend with Mom
saying, “Cheer up, Millie. I’m sure you’ll make new friends. You just
have to try a little harder.”
2 If they are really so concerned about me, then they would get me
out of volleyball and out of tutoring Stanford Wong.
3 Despite my compelling arguments, my mother does not agree with
the fresh new direction I suggested my summer activities take. In
fact, she even threatened that if I did not stop complaining
(“whining” was the term she used), she would also enroll me in
synchronized swimming. Thus, it was with great reluctance that I
showed up for volleyball again. Luckily, I was already on a team and
did not have to suffer the indignity of being chosen last—there’s
enough of that at school.
4 The game began auspiciously enough with the ball flying back and
forth, unless, of course, it came anywhere in my vicinity. When it
was my turn to serve, I somehow managed to make the ball go
behind me. This produced a great deal of tittering from both sides of
the net. Embarrassed, I moved forward and prayed that the gym
would catch fire or that the ball would explode.
5 A rather tall, scary girl from the other team took her place to serve.
She looked like she could squish me like a bug. Grinning, the girl
tossed the ball up in the air with ease. Then she smashed it in the
desired direction.
6 I squeezed my eyes shut as the ball came barreling down at me in
what seemed like slow motion.

Page 35
7 Suddenly, BANG! Contact. To everyone’s amazement, I sent the ball
flying back to enemy territory. It landed at the feet of the server
and then bounced away.
8 There was a stunned silence as jaws dropped in unison.
9 Then, at once, laughter erupted. It echoed in the gym and I am sure
could be heard throughout Rancho Rosetta.
10 “She kicked the ball!” someone howled.
11 I could have just died.
12 Somehow I managed to struggle through the rest of the game. Not
making eye contact with anyone helped, although I am sure my
teammates were miffed that I kept bumping into them.
13 When at last the game was over, I plopped down against the
bleachers, rummaged through my briefcase, and fished out a bag of
Cheetos and a Gatorade. After I tried in vain to twist the cap off my
drink, the girl sitting next to me took the bottle from me and
opened it on the first try. Of course, I’m sure I had loosened it quite
a bit.
14 I studied the bottle opener and recognized her as one of the few
who did not laugh at me.
15 “Hi,” the girl said.
16 “How do you do?” I answered with some trepidation.
17 “I’m Emily and I just moved here. Don’t you hate volleyball? Isn’t
Coach Gowin just awful? Wouldn’t you just love to get your hands
on whoever gave her that whistle?”
18 She paused for a breath, and I seized the chance to get a word in.
“I’m Millicent L. Min. Yes. Yes. Ha! Yes,” I replied, as I wiped my
palm in anticipation of a more formal introduction and a handshake.
19 You can tell a lot about a person by the way they shake hands.
Some people try to crush your bones to prove that they’re in
control; others barely move their hands and make you do all the
work. Then there’s the firm, friendly “hello-there-sincerely-glad-
to-meet-you” handshake that I strive to achieve. My mother and I
practiced for weeks until I got it right.
20 The girl tossed formalities aside and continued chatting. I smiled
and waited patiently to find out why she thought we were friends. To

my delight, I was surprisingly at ease with Emily. We found
ourselves finishing each other’s sentences. It was so liberating to
talk with someone my own age without the topic of my being a
genius coming up and getting in the way.
21 “My mom thinks volleyball will be good for me . . . you know, get
coordinated and meet new people, blah, blah, blah,” she confided as
she let down her ponytail and shook it out.
22 “So tell me, why are you here? No offense, but you didn’t look like
you enjoyed yourself at all—in fact, a couple of times I thought you
were going to cry.”
23 I could have explained that because I went through school at an
accelerated rate, I was never expected to fully participate in physical
education. Yet if Emily knew I was a genius she might weird out on
me like the rest of them. In a nanosecond I had to decide whether
to tell the truth and risk losing a potential friend, or lie and live with
the consequences.
