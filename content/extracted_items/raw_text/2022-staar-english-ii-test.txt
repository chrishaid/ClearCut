How Military Rations
Changed the Way We Eat
(1) Walk down the aisles of a grocery store and you will
find various cans, boxes, bags, and pouches of food available.
(2) Specialized packaging allows food to be purchased and kept for
long periods of time. (3) Packaged food is a convenient staple in
many households and allows for easy transportation and storage.
(4) The origin of food storage and preservation is the result of many
military advancements in providing provisions for troops far away
from home.
(5) Food spoils if it cannot be preserved. (6) The mixing of
moisture, bacteria, and air makes food deteriorate quickly. (7) This
rotting of food proves to be a huge challenge for troops who
are many miles away from villages, towns, and cities. (8) Early
attempts to provide provisions to troops left them weakened.
(9) Troops were also left malnourished and susceptible to disease,
which could be fatal. (10) It was obvious that something needed
to be done.
(11) The process of canning helped provide quality food
for troops. (12) Canning owes its discovery to Napoleon’s need
to provide adequate nutrition to French troops. (13) To solve
the problem, the French government offered a reward for the
development of a way to preserve food. (14) The solution was to
preserve food in glass jars. (15) Before food was placed into the
glass jars, it was heated to kill any existing bacteria. (16) Then,
the contents of the jars were secured with a lid. (17) When the
food inside the jar cooled, the lid would be vacuumed sealed,
keeping air or new bacteria from entering. (18) This invention
provided troops with edible food that could be transported over
long distances and consumed without worry. (19) However, there
was one problem with this method: glass jars break, leading to the
military-based invention of utilizing metal cans. (20) Now canned
food is common in almost any grocery-store aisle.
English II - REVISING
Page 5Form 001
(21) Other innovations relied on the basic idea of canning:
removing moisture from food. (22) One such method is dehydrating
food. (23) Beyond meat, fruit, and vegetables, dehydration was
used for dairy, especially cheese. (24) Dehydrated cheese is
found in almost anything cheese flavored, from chips to pasta.
(25) Freeze drying was another dehydration method employed.
(26) In preserving coffee and making it “instant,” freeze drying is
frequently used. (27) It is also used in other “add water” food such
as instant breakfasts and soups, providing the bits of fruits and
vegetables that are present. (28) As military innovators continued
to experiment, they realized that the addition of salt and sugar
could prevent the water molecules in food from interacting with
other ingredients, thus extending the freshness, or shelf life, of
food.
(29) Using heat to remove moisture helps to preserve foods,
but military researchers also wanted to address the problem of
bacteria. (30) They developed a method of using pressure to
eliminate bacteria. (31) The force used to generate the pressure is
so great that it destroys any bacteria, thereby sterilizing the food.
(32) The sterilization creates food that can be consumed safely
without the need for preservatives. (33) Salsas, guacamole, and
deli meats all benefit from this process.
(34) The need for quick, easy, convenient, long-lasting food
that can be transported and stored and consumed days, months,
or years later is due to military innovations. (35) These military
innovations have made their way into grocery stores and ultimately
the pantries and kitchens of all. (36) Without a doubt, military
rations have dramatically changed the way people eat.

April wrote this essay about the history of a hobby she enjoys. Read
April’s essay and look for revisions she needs to make. Then answer
the questions that follow.
The History of Skateboarding
(1) In 2020 at the 32nd Olympic Summer Games in Tokyo,
Japan, skateboarding will appear. (2) An activity once seen as
fringe and rebellious will be legitimized as a global sport.
(3) Skateboarding began as a hobby. (4) It was an alternative
way for surfers to continue what they enjoyed when the ocean was
not producing rideable waves. (5) Despite this humble beginning,
skateboarding has transformed through the years from a pastime to
an influential, cultural mainstay.
(6) Skateboarding began with the idea of taking roller skate
wheels and affixing those wheels to a strip of wood. (7) It was
initially referred to as “sidewalk surfing.” (8) While these crude
“skateboards” allowed surfers to ride when the waves were down,
the boards lacked maneuverability and rattled and vibrated on
the concrete sidewalks and asphalt streets. (9) Although the
early boards were homemade, commercial manufacturers began
producing skateboards. (10) While the commercial manufacturers
promoted skateboarding through sanctioned competitions, they
did little to improve upon the original design, and by the mid-’60s,
safety concerns stymied the rise of skateboarding.
(11) While the sport failed to grab the general public’s
attention, there were still those who continued skateboarding
despite the safety concerns. (12) They saw opportunities
to improve the original design and create safer and more
maneuverable boards. (13) One of those people was inventor
Richard Stevenson. (14) He also replaced the common steel
wheels with clay ones. (15) Stevenson, however, did not stop
there. (16) He also transformed skateboarding with his addition
of the kicktail. (17) A kicktail is the curved section on the back
of the board, which allows skateboards to fly. (18) With these
improvements, they now had more control and could perform
aerial stunts.
(19) Not satisfied with Stevenson’s use of clay wheels,
Frank Nasworthy stumbled upon the idea to use urethane wheels.
(20) Urethane is commonly found in the midsoles of athletic
English II - REVISING
Page 9Form 001
shoes. (21) Nasworthy’s wheels allowed the skateboards to
better grip surfaces and provided the additional benefit of more
control. (22) Both Stevenson’s and Nasworthy’s contributions in
the ’70s revolutionized skateboarding. (23) Their contributions
saved it from the brink of extinction and placed it in the
mainstream as municipalities became dotted with skate parks.
(24) Skateboarding’s popularity, however, would fall again due to
safety concerns as many skate parks could not afford the insurance
premiums needed to protect themselves and the skaters who used
their parks.
(25) Despite this setback, skateboarding did not disappear;
it just went underground. (26) Skateboarding soon became a
subculture of the youth, gaining popularity as documentary-style,
straight-to-video films launched the careers of many who are
now household names. (27) These videos paved the way for the
emergence of large competitions. (28) ESPN, as a sports network,
saw a way to introduce the world to the relatively new phenomena
of action sports. (29) In 1995, ESPN would create the X-Games,
which showcased nine sports with 27 events over a week.
(30) The X-Games placed the subculture of skateboarding
on the main stage. (31) Utilizing the formula that made ESPN
connect with a younger audience, the Olympics’ governing body
decided to include skateboarding in the 2020 Games. (32) They
are hoping that skateboarding will rejuvenate the Olympics while
at the same time showcasing the Olympic spirit of sportsmanship.
(33) Skateboarders have always embodied the Olympic values.
(34) Skateboarding has always been more about appreciation of
others’ abilities and talents than strictly about the competition.

Mordecai has written this essay to explain an invention that will
benefit areas of the world that lack clean drinking water. Read
Mordecai’s essay and look for any corrections that he needs to
make. When you finish reading, answer the questions that follow.
Using Solar Power to
Clean Drinking Water
(1) What happens when you combine three universities,
a worldwide need, and an ancient technology? (2) The result
is an innovative and modern machine based on an old idea.
(3) Engineers from the University at Buffalo, Fudan University in
China, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have come together
with funding from the National Science Foundation to produce an
efficient and cost-effective device that filters drinking water using
the world’s most abundant power source—the sun.
(4) The need for clean drinking water has been present since
humans have been on Earth. (5) More than 2,300 years ago, the
philosopher Aristotle described the water cycle in his writing titled
Meteorology. (6) He explained that water is heated by the sun,
evaporates up into the air, condenses into drops, and then fell back
to the ground, pure and free of contaminants. (7) The evaporative
stage is what purifies the water. (8) Devices known as solar stills
replicate this natural water purification process. (9) The earliest
solar stills were used by sailors to convert seawater to fresh water.
(10) Despite this knowledge about how to generate clean
water using evaporation, pure drinking water is not available
everywhere. (11) It is estimated that over one billion people
worldwide lack clean drinking water. (12) University at Buffalo
Professor Qiaoqiang Gan and the other engineers funded by
the National Science Foundation recognized this need. (13) In
response, they created a method of purifying water that builds
upon Aristotle’s ancient observations.
(14) Gan’s team invented a solar water purifier that is a
modern version of an evaporative solar still. (15) This device
resembles the roof of a tent, with a strip of carbon-coated paper
draped over the top so that the paper strip hangs down on the sides
in a slight slope. (16) The ends of the paper strip dip into a water
container at the bottom. (17) Gradually, the water in the container
English II - EDITING
Page 15Form 001
is absorbed by the paper. (18) When the black carbon coating
on the paper is heated by the sun, the wet paper begins to dry.
(19) During evaporation, salt, dirt, bacteria, and other contaminants
are trapped in the paper. (20) As the temperature cools, water
droplets begin to condense on the surface of the paper. (21) The
purified water is collected in a clean container and is ready to drink.
(22) There are a few key advantages of the solar water
purifier. (23) First, the device is quick and efficient. (24) The
solar still can generate up to 5 gallons of clean water daily,
which is enough to provide sufficient drinking water for a family.
(25) Furthermore, this solar water purifier is cheaper than other
water-purification devices because they are made with inexpensive
and widely available materials. (26) However, there are also
disadvantages of using the solar water purifier. (27) The diversity
of environments’ on Earth presents design challenges that have
put Gan and the other engineers to the test. (28) One challenge
is tweaking the device to accommodate different water types.
(29) The solar water purifier can filter salt water to make it drinkable,
however, the salt left behind quickly builds up and hinders the
process. (30) Humid environments also create a challenge, since
little water can evaporate into moist air. (31) Gan and his team,
who are funded by a special grant, continue to adjust their device to
correct these issues.
(32) Currently, the engineers are working to make their
purifier available worldwide. (33) Soon, drinkable water will be
purified and assessible where it is needed. (34) The future of solar
water purification looks bright.

Lucia has written this essay for her history class. Read Lucia’s essay
and look for any corrections that she needs to make. When you
finish reading, answer the questions that follow.
Teens and Politics
(1) News and social media expose people to current issues
every day, and this information can influence the decisions adults
make when they enter the voting booth. (2) Teenagers are exposed
to the same news information; some may feel that their voices are
stifled because they are not yet old enough to vote. (3) However,
there are other ways for young people to express their views and to
become involved in politics.
(4) Most students are introduced to politics through student
government or student-council programs at school. (5) Students
can run for class president, vice president, treasurer, and other
positions. (6) Teens elected to office can have an impact regarding
issues that affect their schools. (7) But teens don’t need to stop
at school elections. (8) In some states, teens can actually run for
political office, and in Kansas and Vermont, teenagers are doing just
that.
(9) Ethan Sonneborn, a 14-year-old student at Mt. Abraham
Union middle school in Bristol, Vermont, became interested in
politics when he was in elementary school. (10) He was at a yard
sale when an encyclopedia with a photo of Senator Robert Kennedy
caught his eye. (11) After reading the entry about the former
senator and presidential candidate, Ethan continued to research
Kennedy and developed a strong admiration for the man’s political
prowess. (12) Eventually, that political interest led Ethan to run for
governor. (13) That’s right—a 14-year-old student decided to run
for governor of Vermont! (14) As if that weren’t surprising enough
Ethan is not the only teenage gubernatorial candidate this year.
(15) Tyler Ruzich is a junior at Shawnee Mission High School
in Overland Park, Kansas. (16) He is a candidate for governor of
Kansas. (17) Tyler is the captain of his school’s debate team and
keeps a poster-size version of the U.S. Constitution plastered on
his bedroom wall. (18) To show her support, his 11-year-old sister
wears a pale blue T-shirt with the slogan “Ruzich for Governor.”
(19) When it is time to attend political events or interviews, Tyler,
English II - EDITING
Page 19Form 001
who bags groceries at the local grocery store, asks coworkers to
cover his shifts. (20) Since this job allows those to interact with
people of all ages and from all walks of life, Tyler feels that working
there actually has helped his political aspirations.
(21) Tyler is running against 16-year-old Jack Bergeson, an
honor student and defensive end on his high school’s football team.
(22) Jack convinced Tyler to get into politics because Jack believes
running for office can help teens impact their home states.
(23) Along with Tyler and Jack, there are four other teenagers
running for the governor’s office in Kansas. (24) Kansas also does
not have an age requirement for candidates wishing to hold the
state’s highest office. (25) That could change in the future because
there is a proposed law that would limit elections to candidates
over 18. (26) But for now, the teenagers hold debates, conduct
interviews, and encourage other teens to get involved in local and
state politics.
(27) Of course, not every teen wants to run for political
office. (28) Some may find it overwhelming when they’re not old
enough to vote, and it’s a lot of work. (29) But, as Tyler says, “If
the opportunity is there, and you’re our age, then you’ve got to do
it. (30) It’s the only way we’re going to be able to help address this
crisis of political apathy among the members of our generation.”
(31) Teens are the next generation of leaders, and those who
learn about important issues and become commited might make a
difference in the future.

Millennials. . . So Happy Together
by Neil Howe
Forbes
August 31, 2017
1 WeWork, an upstart that leases shared workspaces, is
now worth more than $20 billion after a multibillion-dollar
investment from SoftBank. In recent years, the co-working
movement—along with its newer cousin, co-living—has turned
into a frenzy. What’s behind this trend? Generational change is
the primary driver. These community-oriented, structured, and
shared concepts appeal to Millennials1—and will likely be around
for the long haul.
2 Over the past decade, co-working spaces have gone from Silicon
Valley “hacker mansions” to full-fledged business enterprises.
There were more than 11,000 co-working spaces worldwide in
2016—up from just 14 in 2007. WeWork itself opened nearly
10,000 desks across eight countries in December 2016 alone.
Co-living has also surged: Companies like Common, Ollie, and
Outsite explicitly organize housing options around the idea of
group living. Last year, WeWork even launched its own dedicated
co-living arm, WeLive.
3 Both co-working and co-living represent a profound shift from
the traditional work and home setup. Co-working startups
lease office buildings and sublet the space to teleworking
professionals, independent contractors, and small companies.
These individuals or groups rent or pay a membership fee
(monthly or daily) to work in a shared space with others.
These spaces are explicitly designed for interaction. (WeWork
co-founder Adam Neumann calls it “the physical social network.”)
Whether it’s networking events or monthly pancake breakfasts,
co-working companies ensure that no one remains anonymous
in the workplace.
4 Co-living is an extension of this trend. Co-living startups
lease apartment buildings and rent out bedrooms to
1Millennials have birth years starting from the early 1980s and ending in the mid-1990s to
early 2000s.
English II
Page 27Form 001
individuals—often at a much lower cost than a one-bedroom
apartment. What’s the catch? Residents must share bathrooms,
kitchens, and common areas. (Think “dorms for adults.”)
Like their co-working counterparts, co-living companies offer
a wide range of conveniences, including laundry services,
housecleaning, and scheduled events.
5 What is fueling the rise of these arrangements? The answer is
simple: These spaces tap into the Millennial mindset.
6 Most importantly, the co-working/co-living movement reflects
Millennials’ desire for community. Unlike young Boomers, whose
life goal was to be master of one’s own home and solo alpha
professional in the corner office, Millennials would rather do
most of their living and working with others. Before co-working
spaces, work-at-home contractors would have to formally meet
in order to collaborate and start-up employees would only have
each other to talk to. Today’s co-working spaces give everyone
the daily opportunity to socialize and collaborate.
7 Co-living spaces have a similar mission. These arrangements are
crafted to cure the isolation often felt in big cities. Ajay Yadav,
founder and CEO of Roomi, says that “more residents are opting
to co-live to not only save money but to have a shared city living
experience with a roommate.” And loneliness is a huge problem
for Millennials, many of whom are putting off the relationships
that would normally fill their need for companionship. (This
tension explains the expansive online literature on lonely young
people—as well as the proliferation of apps like MeetUp and
Ameego designed to stave off loneliness.)
8 Millennials like the structure and safety these offerings provide.
In many ways, co-living and co-working environments operate
in loco parentis.2 Co-working startups are responsible for making
sure the printer works and the office stays tidy while workers
concentrate on the task at hand. For Gen Xers3 and Boomers,4
the thrill of startup life was tied to the risk of going it alone.
Millennials, however, want a safety net to catch them if all goes
wrong. Plus, these apartments have a hierarchy of authority
figures who operate as residential advisors—intervening when
conflict arises.
2In loco parentis is acting in the capacity of a parent.
3Generation Xers have birth years starting in the early-to-mid 1960s and ending in the
early 1980s.
4Baby Boomers have birth years starting from the early-to-mid 1940s and ending in the
early 1960s.
English II
Page 28Form 001
9 Millennials don’t mind sharing space with or being dependent
on others. Why own a car when there’s Uber? Or buy a dress
for a work gala when there’s Rent the Runway? The same
mentality applies here. Why pay for my own kitchen when it’s
less expensive to share? And Millennials are willing to trust these
setups. Millennials have been the recipients of special care since
birth—and trust others to look out for their best interests. This
runs completely against Gen-X instinct: These grownup latchkey
kids didn’t have anyone looking out for them and have always
defined adulthood in terms of personal ownership and look-out-
for-yourself independence.
10 Millennials also have a more blended definition of work-life
balance. Millennials want to prove themselves in the office,
which often means going above and beyond the call of
duty—even outside the 9-to-5 workday. This is particularly
true for those in the startup world, where sparks of inspiration
may hit at 3 AM. Co-living and co-working spaces promise that
someone will always be around to help brainstorm for new ideas.
It also means that when every coffee shop is closed, there will
be complimentary caffeine within walking distance.
11 To be sure, there can be such a thing as too much
co-everything—even for Millennials. There are times both at
work and at home when privacy is needed. Although co-working
startup Alley offers private phone booths, open offices have
been known to raise generational tensions. Additionally, these
environments require strict rules to keep the peace. For
rule-abiding Millennials, “community policing” often is seen as
being for the best of the group. For older generations who don’t
want to be told what to do, that might not fly over so well.

hair net, whose thick fingers dig into the sides of her face in an
agony of desire to sympathize with everything that is said to
her. “Oh I know I know I know,” she groans. Last night when
Desmond’s wife mentioned how tired she was after the long
drive down from Dublin, her fingers plucked at her face, her dull
eyes rolled up to search for help along the ceiling: “Oh I know I
know I know.” There is no end to her sympathy, there is nothing
she doesn’t already know. But she will be quiet as a mouse, she
promised, they won’t know she is here.
2 “Maybe she’s a writer,” Desmond’s wife whispered to him, later
in bed. “Maybe she’s making notes on us. Maybe she’s writing a
book called North Americans I Have Eaves-Dropped On.”
3 “I can’t live with someone listening to me breathe,” Desmond
said. “And I can’t write with someone sitting waiting.”
4 “Adjust,” his wife said, and flicked at his nose. She who could
adjust to anything, or absorb it.
5 On this first day of his novel Desmond has been abandoned by
his wife, Carrie, who early this morning drove the car in to Cork.
There are still, apparently, a few Seamus Murphy Statues she
hasn’t seen, or touched. “Keep half an eye on the kids,” she
said before she left. Then she came back and kissed him and
whispered, “Though if you get busy it won’t matter. I’m sure
Mrs. O’Sullivan won’t miss anything.” To be fair, to be really fair,
English II
Page 30Form 001
he knows that his annoyance is unjustified. He didn’t tell her he
intended to work today, the first day in this house. She probably
thinks that after travelling for six weeks through the country
he’ll rest a few more days before beginning; she may even
believe that he is glad to be rid of her for the day, after all those
weeks of unavoidable closeness. She certainly knows that with
Mrs. O’Sullivan in the house no emergency will be overlooked,
no crisis ignored.
6 Desmond now that his hands have warmed a little lifts one of
the pens to write, though silently as possible, as if what he is
about to do is a secret perversion from which the ears of Mrs.
O’Sullivan must be protected. But he cannot, now, put down
any new words. Because if the novel, which has been roaring
around his head all summer and much longer looking for a
chance to get out, should not recognize in the opening words
the crack through which it is to spring forth, transformed into
a string of words like a whirring fish line, then he will be left
with all that paper to stare at, and an unmoving pen, and he is
not ready to face that. Of course he knows the story, has seen
it all in his mind a hundred times as if someone else had gone
to the trouble of writing it and producing it as a movie just for
him. But he has never been one for plunging into things, oceans
or stories, and prefers to work his way in gently. That opening
paragraph, though, is only a paragraph after all and has no
magic, only a few black lifeless lines at the top of the paper.
So he writes it out again, beneath the first time, and again
under that, and again, hoping that the pen will go on by itself
to write the next words and surprise him. But it does not
happen, not now.

from Prodigy
by Mary Hall Surface
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) was considered a musical
genius. He played multiple instruments and was an extremely
talented performer and composer. He began performing publicly at
the age of six and continued to perform for the rest of his childhood
and adolescence. Mozart’s father eventually quit his job so that he
could oversee his son’s and daughter’s musical careers. The play
Prodigy, written in 1988, examines some of the family dynamics
that provided a backdrop for Mozart’s rise to fame.
1 WOLFGANG: Poppa!
2 LEOPOLD: Not now, Wolfgang. I need to finalize everything for
your concert. There are so many details—
3 ANNA MARIA: But shouldn’t you rest, dear? You were running
about town all morning, receiving guests all afternoon. It’s not
so important.
4 LEOPOLD: Are you so unaware of how crucial this concert is to
us? We stand to earn more money in a single evening than all
the evenings spent bowing before the aristocracy combined.
5 ANNA MARIA: But we have done very well in London, Leopold.
Why is this one night keeping you in such a fuss?
6 WOLFGANG: Poppa—
7 LEOPOLD: Because every noble in London is clamoring for
tickets. Wolfgang is the biggest attraction of London’s social
season. They are coming to us now. And we must astound them.
And take them for every pence they are worth.
8 ANNA MARIA: Honestly, Leopold. I should think you would be
more concerned over all the dreadful rumors about Wolferl’s
abilities. What about his feelings? To think that some people
believe that he is only a puppet.
9 WOLFGANG: [Bursting in.] Poppa! I have written a symphony.
English II

10 LEOPOLD: What?
11 WOLFGANG: A symphony. Have I pleased you?
12 LEOPOLD: Son. A complete symphony—
13 [A visitor arrives. Leopold puts aside the music that Wolfgang
has handed him.]
14 BARRINGTON: Herr Mozart.
15 LEOPOLD: Your servant, sir.
16 BARRINGTON: I realize that the visitations to the child prodigy
are scheduled to conclude at two but I imagine you might spare
a few moments for me.
17 ANNA MARIA: [Clicking into role.] It is our pleasure to
welcome all into our home who desire to see our talented son.
18 BARRINGTON: So this is the wonder boy.
19 WOLFGANG: [Returning to his manuscript.] Hello.
20 BARRINGTON: It is an honor, young man.
21 LEOPOLD: Indeed, I think it is our honor, is it not, sir? Are you
not Daines Barrington?
22 BARRINGTON: I am.
23 LEOPOLD: Your scholarly writings on music are most
impressive, sir.
24 BARRINGTON: And influential, which is why I am here.
25 LEOPOLD: Sir?
26 BARRINGTON: My colleagues at the Royal Academy of Music
enjoy a bit of sport. So they have challenged me to administer a
test to your son.
27 ANNA MARIA: A test?
28 BARRINGTON: To determine scientifically the exact level of his
musical skill.
29 LEOPOLD: For what purpose, sir?
English II
Page 44Form 001
30 BARRINGTON: The musical establishment requires verifiable
proof regarding the child’s abilities. How else can we respond to
the rumors about town? Some say he is your mechanical toy.
Others say that he will write an opera before he is twelve.
[He picks up the music Wolfgang has been working on.] Did
you write this, little man?
31 [Wolfgang nods.]
32 LEOPOLD: And how would the results of the test be made
known?
33 BARRINGTON: I plan to address the Royal Society of Musicians.
With my reputation as a musical scholar, my word can hardly
be refuted.
34 LEOPOLD: How perfect.
35 ANNA MARIA: Mr. Barrington, how would such a test be given?
36 BARRINGTON: [Looking at the music, he is astounded.] I had
no idea . . . Your son would be confined to a room for a full
afternoon of performance exercises.
37 LEOPOLD: Why not extend the examination, sir, to test his skills
of composition as well?
38 BARRINGTON: That would be a rigorous examination, Herr
Mozart, lasting three days I should think.
39 ANNA MARIA: Three days? He is only a child, sir.
40 LEOPOLD: But three days well spent, proving once and for all
that Wolfgang is indeed a child and a musical genius.
41 BARRINGTON: I welcome the challenge, sir.
42 LEOPOLD: I will make sure that my son is fully prepared to
excel in your examination.
43 ANNA MARIA: Why are you doing this?
44 BARRINGTON: Because, Madam, I believe your son may have
a brilliant future. Possibly more brilliant than any of us can
imagine. Unfounded rumors will only stand in his way. Herr
Mozart, I will contact you tomorrow to arrange the details.
45 LEOPOLD: I shall eagerly await them, sir.

46 BARRINGTON: [Exiting.] Farewell.
47 LEOPOLD: What a perfect opportunity! The final blow to all who
are set against the success of my Gala concert. This test will
silence them, won’t it, son?
48 ANNA MARIA: Leopold! Are you mad? Why must Wolfgang be
subjected to such a test?
49 LEOPOLD: You just heard why. Don’t you understand, or must
I explain it to you?
50 ANNA MARIA: I understand. I understand that Wolfgang no
longer matters to you.
51 LEOPOLD: What?
52 ANNA MARIA: He has become a puppet to you.
53 LEOPOLD: Don’t be absurd.
54 ANNA MARIA: No. You are the one who is absurd. And wrong!
“A test to see if Wolfgang is a child?” You have never let him be
a child—always pushing him to live up to your dreams.
55 LEOPOLD: Of course they are my dreams, just as they are his.
Wolfgang’s only desire is to be a great musician.
56 ANNA MARIA: It is your desire! Admit to that at least.
57 LEOPOLD: I have always made decisions in his best interest—
58 ANNA MARIA: Your interest! To win a place in a society where
we don’t belong.
59 LEOPOLD: What’s this? You are the one who was always so
impressed by the glitter of the court.
60 ANNA MARIA: Of course I was. But I was content to dream
of dressing like an Empress someday. You are using our child
to prove something—something to a group of people whom
you despise.
61 LEOPOLD: I haven’t used him. I gave Wolfgang choices all
along the way.

means, do you?

64 ANNA MARIA: You have made every decision of his life for him.
A child? He’ll probably remain a child all his life because of the
way you have treated him. He’s helpless.
65 LEOPOLD: He will always be in my care!
66 ANNA MARIA: I am sure he will. Playing out your ambitions at
his expense. Do you ever consider if Wolfgang is happy?
67 LEOPOLD: Happy? He is brilliant!
68 ANNA MARIA: And that is all that matters?
69 LEOPOLD: His music is what matters! Wolfgang is his music!
70 ANNA MARIA: Oh Leopold, no. He is so much more. You don’t
see it anymore. I’ve watched it happen. Every day he slips
further away from you. He needs you . . . just to be his Poppa.
71 LEOPOLD: He is undisciplined, impulsive. His music will be lost
if I am not in control of him.
72 ANNA MARIA: So you would rather lose your son?
73 LEOPOLD: He is devoted to me!
74 ANNA MARIA: What choice does he have?

Teen Studies Better
Cleaning through Chemistry
by Bethany Brookshire
Science News for Students
November 11, 2016
1 Inspiration for science projects can be found almost anywhere,
even in the most common of tasks. Nathan Deng, 14, found
his doing the dishes. The teen wondered why hot water worked
better than cold water when washing, and what made soap a
good cleaner. The simple experiments he devised to investigate
these matters earned him the Lemelson Award for Invention
here at the Broadcom MASTERS.
2 MASTERS stands for Math, Applied Science, Technology and
Engineering for Rising Stars. Every year, this event brings
together 30 middle-school students from around the country to
share their award-winning science fair projects. The competition
was created by Society for Science & the Public—which publishes
Science News for Students. It’s sponsored by the Broadcom
Foundation.
3 Nathan—now a freshman at San Marino High School in
California—doesn’t like his household chores any more than
anybody else. But he said doing them made him curious about
why we use hot water and soap to clean. The teen was further
inspired by something he read about the Deepwater Horizon oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. To clean up the mess, planes
sprayed the water with a chemical mix called Corexit. It was
supposed to help disperse the oil, preventing it from clumping
on the surface and coating the wildlife, though it didn’t work well.
4 “I decided that I wanted to find a method for cleaning that is
both efficient and environmentally friendly,” he says.
5 But this is a big goal, so the teen started small. He decided to
look at surface tension—an effect that occurs when molecules
bond to each other on the surface of a liquid. Surface tension is
why, when you fill a glass just a little too much, the water forms
a tiny lump at the top. This is great for keeping water in your
English II
Page 52Form 001
glass but bad for cleaning, Nathan explains. Dishes are riddled
with tiny cracks and pores—places where dirt and germs can
hide. Surface tension holds water together, keeping it out of
these itty bitty spots. Instead of going into the pores where it
can reach the dirt, the water bridges over these places, Nathan
explains. And that “can make it difficult to clean the stuff stuck
in the crevices,” he says.
6 The teen wanted to see how he might reduce the surface tension
of water. That would break up the bridging over the pores, he
explains. Then, the water could flush through and rinse out the
dirty substances.
Weighty Water
7 Nathan didn’t have a lot of fancy equipment to work with. That
didn’t stop him. To measure surface tension, he gathered a large
plastic syringe, some tubing, a kitchen scale—and of course
some water. If a water droplet has a high surface tension, it
holds together longer—and gets bigger—before a drop breaks
apart. Nathan filled his syringe with water and slowly pushed
it out over the scale. Bigger drops have more surface tension.
So by weighing his drops, the teen could find out if changes he
made to the water increased or decreased the surface tension.
8 Nathan started with drops of water that had different
temperatures. As water gets hotter, the molecules in it move
faster. The teen hypothesized that this would make it harder for
the water to form a film on the surface and its surface tension
would decrease. He tested water at 5°, 15°, 20°, 35° and
English II
Page 53Form 001
50° Celsius (41°, 59°, 68°, 95° and 122° Fahrenheit). Nathan
avoided water at 0 °C (32 °F) since ice doesn’t drip well. He
also avoided boiling water, which could get dangerous. The teen
dripped water at each temperature and weighed it to determine
the size of his drops, running each temperature test three times.
9 As the temperature of the water increased, the size of the
drops decreased, which suggested the surface tension was also
decreasing. Nathan concluded that cleaning a dish with hot
water is probably more efficient than cold.
10 Next, he tested soap—or rather a main ingredient in it, sodium
lauryl sulfoacetate (or SLSA). This chemical is a surfactant—a
chemical that decreases the attraction between water molecules,
which lowers surface tension. Nathan tested pure water, water
with 0.01375 percent, 0.01275 percent, 0.055 percent,
0.1 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent SLSA. (All were held
at the same temperature of 20 °C.) He dripped and weighed his
mixtures again.
11 The addition of the surfactant decreased surface tension more
than simply heating water, Nathan found. After reading more
about the chemical, the teen discovered that SLSA is a chemical
with two ends. One is hydrophobic—it is repelled by water. The
other is hydrophilic, or attracted to water. When SLSA with its
two ends is placed in water, the molecules of the chemical line
up at the water’s surface. Their hydrophobic heads stick out into
the air while their hydrophilic tails stay comfortably in the water.
This film of molecules means water can’t form its usual bonds at
the surface. The whole mixture has lower surface tension.
12 At high concentrations of SLSA, something else happens. The
surface of the water is filled with the chemical, and the rest
of the molecules are stuck under the water. There they form
clumps called micelles. These clumps are very good for cleaning
up oil, Nathan notes. Oil is also hydrophobic, and a micelle
isolates the oil from the water.
13 Finally, Nathan wanted to see what would happen if he added
regular old table salt. He thought that salt might decrease
surface tension, because adding the tiny molecules to the water
would stop the water bonding to itself at the surface. But he
found that salt made very little difference.

14 The teen ended up with an answer to why we use hot water and
soap to clean dishes instead of cold water alone. Both reduce
surface tension. And this helps water get into the nooks and
crannies of our dirty dishes. If you have no soap, he says, use
hot water. But adding soap is usually a good idea.
15 Nathan found that his apparatus—a syringe and tube with
a scale—was great for measuring surface tension. He wants
to sell his setup as a surface tension kit for classrooms, so
other teens can do his experiments. Then they, too, can learn
that invention and research don’t require fancy materials or
expensive equipment.

52 What is the best summary of the article?
F Every year Broadcom MASTERS awards the Lemelson Award for
Invention to a middle school student. MASTERS, which stands
for Math, Applied Science, Technology and Engineering for Rising
Stars, is an event that recognizes middle school students for their
scientific achievements. Nathan Deng won the award by creating an
experiment that tests how well hot water and soap clean dishes. He
wants other teams to conduct the same experiment.
G Nathan Deng was able to construct an experiment that determined
why hot water and soap are used to clean dishes. He kept the
experiment simple by only testing the surface tension of water. The
surface tension of water is the effect that results when molecules
bond to each other on the surface of the liquid. Nathan found that
hot water and soap reduce surface tension.
H Nathan Deng’s use of simple experimentation to answer basic
questions about dish washing won him the Lemelson Award for
Invention. Curious about why hot water and soap were needed to
clean dishes, Nathan set up an experiment to test surface tension.
Nathan tested drops of water at different temperatures as well as
the use of a soap ingredient to determine their effects on surface
tension. He found that soap and hot water are most effective.
J Inspiration for science projects can come from everyday life. For
this reason, anyone can complete a science project. Nathan Deng
investigated the way soap and hot water affect the cleanliness of
dishes. There are often tiny cracks in dishes that are difficult to
reach when washing dishes. Surface tension keeps water out of
these spaces. Nathan’s experiment showed that using soap and hot
water would be effective.
