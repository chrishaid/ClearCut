J.T. wrote this paper about a unique Japanese activity. Read the paper and look for
any revisions J.T. should make. Then answer the questions that follow.
In Sync
(1) Texas is known for its superb high school marching bands. (2) Each week
during football season, thousands of students take to the field to display their
musical and marching talents. (3) These same students also compete in local, state,
and national competitions and exhibitions. (4) However, marching bands aren’t
found in just this state or even just this country. (5) But in one country there are
marchers who skip the music component all together. (6) Students at Japan’s
Nippon Sports Science University, NSSU, participate in an intricate marching-like
exhibition known as precision walking.
(7) NSSU students have perfected the nearly 50-year-old tradition of shuudan
koudou, which means “collective action.” (8) The collective action is a carefully
choreographed display of synchronized walking. (9) Identically dressed students
walk forward and backward to form lines and shapes, even crossing between one
another at times. (10) There are no musical cues for the students to use as they
march in the changing formations. (11) Furthermore, they walk in perfect step by
following the direction of an announcer. (12) Directors bellow loud, sharp
commands, such as “Front row, turn left!” and “Cross walk,” over a loudspeaker.
(13) And with each command, the students fall into perfect alignment. (14) Even
the swing of their arms is synchronized. (15) A misstep by just one student creates
a flaw in the perfectly coordinated display that is visible.
(16) To prepare for an exhibition, students practice three days a week for five
months at a time. (17) They participate in training exercises to help get them in
shape. (18) During this time it is estimated that they walk more than 700 miles,
which is about the same distance as walking across the entire state of Texas!
(19) Many of the students at NSSU will go on to become coaches, physical
education teachers, and trainers. (20) The university also offers master’s and
doctoral degree programs. (21) Keiko Suzuki, captain of the 2014 walking team,
says that by participating in precision walking, she and her classmates will be better
English II
Page 4
prepared for their careers. (22) “We all mastered this highly disciplined training and
made it our habit to stick to strict rules,” said Suzuki. (23) “I believe this experience
will be an asset as we enter into the job market.”
(24) At a recent NSSU festival, close to 11,000 spectators watched as the
students performed their walking routine. (25) The school posted a video of the
performance on the Internet, where it was watched and shared by thousands of
viewers. (26) The announcer commented that people at NSSU were extremely proud
that the school’s distinctive tradition has now become famous around the world.

Mimi has written this essay to express her opinion about reusable water bottles.
Read Mimi’s essay and look for the revisions she should make. Then answer the
questions that follow.
Make the Switch!
(1) Sweating during a summer afternoon in Texas, people gaze into
convenience-store refrigerators. (2) They select chilled bottles of water and stand in
line at the register, where they might pay more than $2.00 per bottle. (3) After
chugging the water, they toss the bottles into the trash. (4) What’s wrong with this
picture? (5) Consumers pay far too much for a drink of water, and those same
bottles clog oceans and contaminate the soil. (6) This needs to stop now!
(7) Although bottled water is often advertised for its purity, the quality of this
water is not necessarily better than that of tap water. (8) Bottled water may be
attractively packaged. (9) It is simply processed tap water. (10) In fact, there is
reason to be concerned about its contents in many cases. (11) When plastic is
exposed to heat, it can release harmful chemicals into the water, chemicals that
scientists have linked to illnesses. (12) The government regulates only 30–40% of
English II
Page 8
all bottled water, so it can be difficult to know exactly what processes a bottle of
water has gone through to ensure its quality. (13) In contrast, municipal water
systems are inspected annually to ensure city residents have safe drinking water.
(14) The safety of bottled water not only raises health concerns, but bottled
water is also significantly overpriced in comparison to tap water. (15) In fact, it can
cost as much as 2,000 times more than tap water. (16) For instance, at eight
glasses a day, the yearly cost for tap water is about 50 cents. (17) The same
amount of bottled water would cost well over $1,000. (18) Most people can probably
think of better ways to spend that money.
(19) The unnecessary use of bottles causes environmental damage at several
stages. (20) Consider the resources used to produce and transport bottled water.
(21) Also consider that chemicals are released by these many bottles when they are
discarded into landfills over hundreds of years and decompose. (22) Other bottles
may end up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. (23) The Ocean Conservancy has
determined that every square mile of the ocean is contaminated with 46,000 pieces
of plastic.
(24) As consumers, we can help our budgets and our world with one simple
choice: make the switch to reusable water bottles! (25) For only about $10 to $15,
one can buy a reusable bottle that is not only useful but looks great too.
(26) Reusable water bottles come in a variety of colors and styles. (27) Many come
with hooks that attach to backpacks or straps that allow the bottles to be worn on
the body. (28) Reusable bottles with filters are also available so that tap water can
be further purified before drinking. (29) With all of these great features, there’s
really no reason to buy plastic water bottles ever again.
English II
Page 9
5 Mimi’s essay does not have a strong position statement. Which of the following sentences
should replace sentence 6 to serve as an effective position statement?
A It’s foolish to buy several bottles of water each day when there’s no good reason for doing
this.
B People need to stop doing this now and protest against bottled-water companies.
C These problems can be solved, however, if people choose to drink water from reusable
containers instead of plastic bottles.
D The list of problems that people are causing, such as increasing pollution, by buying
bottled water is endless.
6 What is the most effective way to combine sentences 8 and 9?
F Bottled water may be attractively packaged, but it is simply processed tap water.
G Bottled water is simply processed tap water because it is attractively packaged.
H Bottled water may be attractively packaged, so it is simply processed tap water.
J Bottled water is attractively packaged, because it is simply processed tap water.
7 Mimi wants to improve the transition between the third paragraph (sentences 14–18) and the
fourth paragraph (sentences 19–23). Which sentence can be added before sentence 19 to
accomplish this goal?
A Because bottled water can cost so much, a reusable water bottle is a wise investment.
B People think bottled water is harmless, and other plastic containers are just as bad.
C Money is a concern for many people, so it should be saved whenever possible.
D Bottled water is a huge monetary expense, but the cost to our planet is even greater.
English II
Page 10
8 What is the most effective way to revise sentence 21?
F Also consider that many bottles are discarded into landfills, where the bottles release
chemicals as they decompose over hundreds of years.
G Also consider that landfills are filled with released chemicals, where they decompose many
discarded bottles over hundreds of years.
H These bottles, decomposing over hundreds of years, should also be considered to release
chemicals where they have been discarded into landfills.
J Over hundreds of years, landfills are filled with many bottles, and it should also be
considered that the bottles decompose and release chemicals.
9 Mimi wants to conclude her essay by motivating her readers to take action. Which of the
following statements should she insert after sentence 29 to accomplish this goal?
A The future of our planet depends on people like you doing away with a terrible
threat—plastic water bottles.
B We should make the decision today to be smart about our finances and responsible with
our planet by opting for reusable water bottles.
C Think of how much you can help the fish in our lakes, rivers, and oceans by avoiding
bottled water.
D Choose reusable water bottles, and watch your savings grow.

Savannah wrote this essay for a descriptive writing assignment in her English class.
Read Savannah’s essay and look for corrections she should make. Then answer the
questions that follow.
Smells Like a Memory
(1) The acrid scent of burning firewood wafts through the crisp night air.
(2) Suddenly being transported back to childhood as a memory plays in my mind like
a movie. (3) My dad, brothers, and I are lounging around a campfire, spearing
marshmallows with sticks and holding them over the open flames. (4) My
marshmallow catches fire, and I turn it slowly, letting it brown on all sides before
blowing it out. (5) I pull gently at its crisp brown shell, the aroma of its gooey
sweetness teases my nostrils. (6) I wait impatiently for it to cool enough to put in
my mouth.
(7) Memories always seem to flood my mind when I experience certain
smells. (8) The smell of freshly cut grass reminds me of my twelve-year-old self,
playing Soccer on Saturday mornings. (9) I can still smell the warm, damp dirt and
hear the voice of my best friend Erin calling out as I wiped the sweat beads off my
forehead. (10) After playing for hours, we would all traipse down to the local corner
store to buy beverages that were so cold they would make our teeth hurt. (11) I pop
the lid off a bubbly drink, and the fizz gently stings my nose. (12) My mind flashes
back to those lazy afternoons, leaning against the wall in the cool shade of the
store’s striped awning, laughing with my friends.
(13) Then there is the distinctive scent of garlic and onion cooking as my
grandmother prepares the filling for our holiday tamales. (14) I remember when I
was a little girl dragging my chair over to the counter to watch the onions and garlic
cook. (15) I would beg my grandmother to let me help fill the tamales, and she
would let me sample tiny bites along the way. (16) To this day the smell of steaming
tamales fills me with excitement.
(17) It is said that scent is the most powerful memory trigger of all the
senses. (18) The brain is wired in such a way that the sense of smell is processed
near the centers’ of emotion and memory. (19) So it’s no wonder that specific smells
English II
Page 14
can generate amazing memories that make us feel just as we did when the events
originally occurred. (20) Whatever the case may be, I know for myself that certain
smells today always take me back to times that were innocent and full of exploration
and wonder. (21) I’m thankful for the variety of spicy, sweet, and savory smells that
continue to remind me of family, friends, and all the best things in life.

Adam has written this essay to encourage his classmates to try a new food source.
Read Adam’s essay and look for the corrections he needs to make. When you finish
reading, answer the questions that follow.
Try It; You’ll Like It
(1) According to a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations: there are 1,900 edible insect species on Earth. (2) It is not common
for people in the United States to eat insects, but I believe there are many good
reasons for making insects an important part of our diets.
(3) Insects are an important part of the diets of people in many cultures.
(4) In Africa, Asia, Mexico, and South and Central America, many people already eat
insects. (5) The most commonly consumed insect around the world is the
grasshopper, but beetles are popular in the Amazon basin and some parts of Africa.
(6) In the past American Indians also ate beetles by roasting them and eating them
like popcorn.
(7) There are several good reasons for eating insects. (8) They are an
inexpensive source of protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. (9) Grasshoppers and
mealworms are as nutritious as beef and fish, and raising insects instead of cattle or
pigs can be beneficial to the environment. (10) Cattle and pigs require large
amounts of food, but insects need very little, and insects produce much smaller
amounts of greenhouse gases than large animals like cows.
(11) Of course, since Americans are not accustomed to eating insects, many
are hesitant to trying. (12) If you find a worm hiding inside your apple, you will
throw it away, and few want to eat a sandwich with ants in it. (13) For this reason, it
will take a major shift in the way we think about food for Americans to become insect
eaters. (14) Doing so is not impossible, though, because most food preferances are
simply a state of mind. (15) For example, when I was little, I thought oysters were
revolting simply because they looked strange, but I tried them recently and really
liked them. (16) My cousin used to gag at the mushy texture of avocados when her
mother served them, but now she eats them all the time.
English II
Page 18
(17) My interest in eating insects developed during a recent visit by a family
member. (18) My uncle, whose very adventurous, brought some roasted
grasshoppers from Mexico for me to try, and I liked them—they have a nice, salty
crunch. (19) A crunchy grasshopper is just as tasty as a crunchy potato chip and a
lot better for you. (20) And insects have some interesting flavors; wasps are said to
taste like pine nuts, and bee larvae supposedly remind people of peanuts.
(21) Anyone who likes nuts should give wasps or bee larvae a try.
(22) I know that everyone in this class is interested in making choices that
are better for the planet, and many of you have a sense of adventure. (23) I
challenge you to step out of your comfort zone and try eating a tasty insect.

WRITTEN COMPOSITION: Persuasive
Read the information in the box below.
It is common for people to compete with one
another. Competition can foster creativity,
provide valuable lessons, and inspire people to
challenge themselves and achieve things they
never thought possible. On the other hand,
competition can breed selfishness and promote
the idea that the most successful people are
those who have the most power and who will
win no matter what the cost.
Think carefully about the following question.
Do people have to be competitive in order to succeed?
Write an essay stating your position on whether competition is necessary for
success.
Be sure to —
• state your position clearly
• use appropriate organization
• provide specific support for your argument
• choose your words carefully
• edit your writing for grammar, mechanics, and spelling

To a Daughter with Artistic Talent
by Peter Meinke
I know why, getting up in the cold dawn
you paint cold yellow houses
and silver trees. Look at those green birds,
almost real, and that lonely child looking
5 at those houses and trees.
You paint (the best way) without reasoning,
to see what you feel, and green birds
are what a child sees.
Some gifts are not given: you
10 are delivered to them,
bound by chains of nerves and genes
stronger than iron or steel, although
unseen. You have painted every day
for as long as I can remember
15 and will be painting still
when you read this, some cold
and distant December when the child
is old and the trees no longer silver
but black fingers scratching a grey sky.
20 And you never know why (I was lying
before when I said I knew).
You never know the force that drives you wild
to paint that sky, that bird flying,
and is never satisfied today
25 but maybe tomorrow
when the sky is a surreal sea
in which you drown . . .
I tell you this with love and pride
and sorrow, my artist child
30 (while the birds change from green to blue to brown).

Big Fish

1 He takes another sip of water. It seems not to be a matter of thirst so much
as it is a desire for this element, to feel it on his tongue, his lips: he loves the
water. Once upon a time he swam.
2 “But you know, my father was gone a lot, too,” he says, his voice crackling
soft. “So I know what it’s like. My dad was a farmer. I told you that, didn’t I? I
remember once he had to go off somewhere to get a special kind of seed to
plant in the fields. Hopped a freight. Said he’d be back that night. One thing and
another happened and he couldn’t get off. Rode it all the way out to California.
Gone most of the spring. Planting time came and went. But when he came back
he had the most marvelous seeds.”
3 “Let me guess,” I say. “He planted them and a huge vine grew up into the
clouds, and at the top of the clouds was a castle, where a giant lived.”
4 “How did you know?”
5 “And a two-headed woman who served him tea, no doubt.”
6 At this my father tweaks his eyebrows and smiles, for a moment deep in
pleasure.
7 “You remember,” he says.
8 “Sure.”
9 “Remembering a man’s stories makes him immortal, did you know that?”
10 I shake my head.
11 “It does. You never really believed that one though, did you?”
12 “Does it matter?”
13 He looks at me.
14 “No,” he says. Then, “Yes. I don’t know. At least you remembered. The
point is, I think—the point is I tried to get home more. I did. Things happened,
though. Natural disasters. The earth split once I think, the sky opened several
times. Sometimes I barely made it out alive.”
15 His old scaly hand crawls over to touch my knee. His fingers are white, the
nails cracking and dull, like old silver.
16 “I’d say I’d missed you,” I say, “if I knew what I was missing.”
English II
Page 27
17 “I’ll tell you what the problem was,” he says, lifting his hand from my knee
and motioning for me to come closer. And I do. I want to hear. The next word
could be his last.
18 “I wanted to be a great man,” he whispers.
19 “Really?” I say, as if this comes as some sort of surprise to me.
20 “Really,” he says. His words come slow and weak but steady and strong in
feeling and thought. “Can you believe it? I thought it was my destiny. A big fish
in a big pond—that’s what I wanted. That’s what I wanted from day one. I
started small. For a long time I worked for other people. Then I started my own
business. I got these molds and I made candles in the basement. That business
failed. I sold baby’s breath to floral shops. That failed. Finally, though, I got into
import/export and everything took off. I had dinner with a prime minister once,
William. A prime minister! Can you imagine, this boy from Ashland having
dinner in the same room with a—. There’s not a continent I haven’t set foot on.
Not one. There are seven of them, right? I’m starting to forget which ones I . . .
never mind. Now all that seems so unimportant, you know? I mean, I don’t even
know what a great man is anymore—the, uh, prerequisites. Do you, William?”
21 “Do I what?”
22 “Know,” he says. “Know what makes a man great.”
23 I think about this for a long time, secretly hoping he forgets he ever asked
the question. His mind has a way of wandering, but something in the way he
looks at me says he’s not forgetting anything now, he’s holding on tight to that
thought, and he’s waiting for my answer. I don’t know what makes a man great.
I’ve never thought about it before. But at a time like this “I don’t know” just
won’t do. This is an occasion one rises to, and so I make myself as light as
possible and wait for a lift.
24 “I think,” I say after a while, waiting for the right words to come, “that if a
man could be said to be loved by his son, then I think that man could be
considered great.”
25 For this is the only power I have, to bestow upon my father the mantle of
greatness, a thing he sought in the wider world, but one that, in a surprise turn
of events, was here at home all along.
26 “Ah,” he says, “those parameters,” he says, stumbling over the word, all of
a sudden seeming slightly woozy. “Never thought about it in those terms,
exactly. Now that we are, though, thinking about it like that, I mean, in this
case,” he says, “in this very specific case, mine—”
27 “Yeah,” I say. “You are hereby and forever after my father, Edward Bloom,
a Very Great Man. So help you Fred.”
28 And in lieu of a sword I touch him once, gently, on the shoulder.
English II
Page 28
29 With these words he seems to rest. His eyes close heavily, and with an
eerie sort of finality that I recognize as the beginning of a departure. When the
window curtains part as though of their own accord I believe for a moment that
this must be the passage of his spirit going from this world to the next. But it’s
only the central air coming on.
30 “About that two-headed lady,” he says with his eyes closed, murmuring, as
if falling into a sleep.
31 “I’ve heard about the two-headed lady,” I say, shaking him gently by the
shoulder. “I don’t want to hear about her anymore, Dad. Okay?”
32 “I wasn’t going to tell you about the two-headed lady, Mr. Smarty-pants,”
he says.
33 “You weren’t?”
34 “I was going to tell you about her sister.”
35 “She had a sister?”
36 “Hey,” he says, opening his eyes now, getting his second wind. “Would I kid
you about something like that?”

Where the Wild Things Are
by Beth Pratt-Bergstrom
Earth Island Journal
1 In 2012, I read a headline in the Los Angeles Times, “Mountain lion makes itself
at home in Griffith Park,” that radically transformed my life’s work. At first
glance I thought it simply a curious story that defied plausibility. How could a
mountain lion be living in the middle of the second largest city in the United
States? And why would the poor cat even want to?
2 Most of my 25-year environmental career has been spent in two of the largest
national parks in this country—Yosemite and Yellowstone. Protected areas like
those fit more with my preconceived notion of where wildlife should live,
especially a large predator. My long-held view of Los Angeles (or of any city
really) dismissed urban centers as environmental wastelands, full of endless
highways, traffic snarls, and unchecked development that had banished all hope
of even a butterfly being able to safely flutter through.
3 Like most opinions founded on ignorance, this proved to be very wrong.
4 After reading about the city-dwelling cougar, I contacted the National Park
Service researchers studying the mountain lion—now famously known as
P-22—and accompanied them on an excursion to track him in Griffith Park. The
park is a hybrid of city and nature surrounded by a spider web of freeways, only
two miles from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and visited by 10 million people
annually. As I trekked around, surrounded by people at every turn and
confronted with the inescapable Hollywood sign and the imposing Los Angeles
skyline, I dismissed this landscape as being about as far from the untrammeled
wilderness of a Yellowstone or Yosemite as one could get. I scoffed at the notion
of “nature” in a park with a golf course, tennis courts, a merry-go-round and
miniature train, the Griffith Observatory, and the Greek Theater.

5 And then I had a life changing epiphany. This cat has more of an imagination
than I do.
6 Why can’t a mountain lion live in a city? Why is the human-built environment
seen as off-limits to wildlife? If it’s good enough for a mountain lion, who are we
to judge?
7 I’ll always be a national park advocate. Yosemite remains my favorite place on
Earth, and I relish my experiences of listening to a wolf howl and watching a
grizzly bear lope by in the wilds of Yellowstone. Five years ago, I would have
laughed hysterically if you had told me I’d soon be dedicating my career to the
conservation of wildlife in cities. But P-22 shifted my perspective. His
remarkable story of crossing two of the busiest freeways in the country to find a
new home, as well as his ability (and those of his Santa Monica Mountain cougar
kin) to adapt to life in a challenging urban interface speaks to the beauty and
resiliency of wild things.
8 After P-22 opened my eyes, I began seeing examples of this new paradigm of
coexistence working across California. Now I focus most of my work on helping
wildlife in cities, and I’ve just finished writing a book on the success stories of
people and wildlife bending our preconceived rules about what is “natural,” and
thriving together instead of apart.
9 You’d be surprised at the places where these stories crop up. In Silicon Valley,
for instance, a family of foxes decided to make a home on the Facebook campus
in Menlo Park along with 2,500 employees, and Mark Zuckerberg himself took an
interest in the skulk. Instead of treating them as pests, the Facebook staff
embraced sharing their workplace with these admittedly adorable wild
neighbors. They even created a FB Fox page that boasts over 100,000 followers
from all over the world. But the interest extended beyond sharing images
suitable for #cuteoverload. The motto of the FB Fox page “Please honor the
foxes—no chasing or feeding—just mutual respect,” speaks to the desire to
ensure the animals stay safe, healthy, and wild. Facebook’s facilities-
management team worked with wildlife officials and contacted a local gray fox
researcher to educate staff about the animal. In one typical pro-fox social media
post, an employee shared a photo of one of the foxes resting under his
automobile with the reminder: “Before you drive off, please check if there is a
fox under or near your car.”
10 The traditional philosophy of conservation has been to segregate people and
wildlife—to set aside islands of habitat—and although we must continue to do
so, it’s not enough. And it’s not entirely working. Even in the best-protected
places on the planet—national parks—some species are having a tough time.
When the number-one threat to wildlife worldwide is loss of habitat, we can no
longer think of our cities or towns or neighborhoods, or even our backyards, as
exempt from the natural world—or as off-limits to wildlife. Our shared spaces
are as essential to conservation as our traditionally protected lands.
English II
Page 39
11 Yes, wildlife would be better served if cities were converted back to open space.
But barring a stunning reversal of the trends of human existence, this won’t
happen any time soon. Given this reality, isn’t a city that incorporates wildlife
surely better than one that doesn’t?
12 Not that every city could, or should, have a mountain lion. But there are many
other creatures, both big and small, that could do with some urban love. Take
the monarch butterfly, for instance. Populations of this amazing orange and
black butterfly, which migrates thousands of miles from Canada to Mexico City,
have declined by as much as 90 percent across the US. The problem? The
plentiful “gas stations” of milkweed and other plants needed to sustain them
along their migration route have largely disappeared. Planting milkweed and
creating habitat is one easy way to help monarch populations rebound, and this
can even be done from an apartment balcony. Wherever we live, we can create
our own “national park” space.
13 National parks and other protected areas are vital to conservation. But what I
have come to realize since that day spent walking in Griffith Park is that cities
are also essential to the future of wildlife. Wouldn’t it be a wonderful legacy for
the next 100 years of national parks if we expanded our values and considered
it just as important for cities to have the same charge as our parks “to conserve
the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife therein and to
provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as
will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations”?
14 Adopting an expanded view of the national park ethic in our urban spaces would
exponentially increase our ability to protect wildlife and biodiversity around the
world.
15 I, for one, believe cities and nature can mix and need to mix for wildlife to have
a future. We need to foster a daily relationship with our wild, nonhuman kin. It’s
not about habituating wildlife to us, but about habituating ourselves to the wild
world.

Your Brain on Movies
by Aaron Millar
Odyssey Magazine
March 2014
1 The fell beast‚ a black dragon with snake teeth and razor talons‚ swoops down
on the wizard Gandalf. Cut to Frodo‚ a hobbit from the Shire‚ holding the ring of
power over the fiery Cracks of Doom. As the ring falls‚ Mount Doom starts to
explode‚ leaving Frodo stranded‚ surrounded on all sides by red-hot lava‚ and
facing certain death.
2 During the final scenes of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King‚ we experience
the full gamut of emotions. We gasp as the flames engulf Frodo; we cheer when
Gandalf saves him. But hobbits do not exist‚ and there never was one ring to
bind them all‚ or save them. So what’s going on? There must be a special kind of
movie magic that makes us believe what we know to be false and care about
what we know isn’t real. Well‚ as it happens‚ there is a special kind of magic‚ but
it’s not in the movie. It’s in the minds of people who watch them.
Handing Over Control
3 Dr. Norman Holland‚ of the University of Florida and author of Literature and the
Brain‚ believes this magic is particularly potent when we watch movies on the
big screen. “The first thing that happens‚” he argues‚ “is you give up control.
The movie is in control.” In normal life our brains are like tractor beams‚ busy
scanning the environment with our senses‚ and sucking up any information that
seems important or interesting: a sudden loud noise‚ a car racing towards us.
This is called the attentional system‚ and it literally means the part of the brain
that directs what we pay attention to. But as the lights come down in the
cinema‚ and the characters come alive on screen‚ we switch off our
tractor beams and let the movie control our attention instead. Edits‚ close-ups‚
sudden on-screen movement—these are all filmmaking techniques that direct
our attention and allow us to cede control to the movie.
4 As that happens‚ we become increasingly absorbed in the film: the real world of
school and parents and homework disappears. We stop sensing our body‚ we
forget where we are‚ we are utterly transported to the world of the silver screen.
Psychologists call this kind of mental state “flow”: when our attention is
completely absorbed in one activity and there isn’t any juice left in the
tractor beam‚ our attentional system‚ to suck up any more information. We are
effortlessly swept along in the currents of the ride. This is why we love the
movies: it’s like going on a roller coaster for the brain.
Are You for Real?
5 But there’s another kind of magic at work here too: as we give up control‚ our
sense of reality changes. “The way we know things are real‚” Holland explains‚
English II
Page 44
“is when we interact with them. In a movie theater we’re not planning to do
anything—we’re not going to change what we’re watching—and that turns off
the systems we use for regulating our actions; in particular it turns off the
system that tells us what’s real and what’s not real.” Deep down we know that
what we’re seeing is make-believe‚ but because we’re not going to act upon it‚
because it doesn’t have a direct physical bearing upon us‚ we don’t test its
plausibility in the same way we do normal life. It’s like that part of our brain
goes on a temporary vacation. Film theorists and psychologists call this
“suspension of disbelief” and because of it‚ fell beasts really are frightening‚ and
we genuinely care about what happens to Frodo.
6 But something else is happening in the brain to make this possible too. In the
same way that a smart phone has different apps for different jobs‚ and each one
has a unique place on your home screen‚ the mind has different abilities‚ and
each one has a distinct place in the brain. “Your knowledge that you’re only
watching a movie happens in the front part of your brain‚” Holland explains.
“That’s the most advanced part‚ where you do your thinking and planning.” But
emotions come from a different area‚ the limbic system‚ in the back of the brain‚
one of the most primitive parts. “We feel real emotions toward unreal fictions,”
Holland says‚ “because two different brain systems are at work.” In other words‚
even though our front brain knows that a movie isn’t real‚ the back brain never
gets the message. When Frodo is rescued from the fire‚ our limbic system
automatically produces a physiological response‚ and a feeling of genuine relief‚
as if it were actually happening. Movies may be an illusion‚ but the emotions
they produce are real.
The Big Screen
7 Sadly‚ the intensity of the emotions that movies produce in us‚ and the
consequent pleasure we get from watching them‚ may actually be diminishing. It
has to do with the new ways in which we consume them. At home‚ or on our
smart phones‚ movies are wonderfully convenient. But watching in this way
limits their magic because we’re in control: we have the power to stop the film
or fast forward bits we don’t like. On top of that‚ we are bombarded with
distractions: unfinished homework lying on the coffee table‚ the text message
that’s just arrived from a friend. The cinema is designed to take us away from
all of that‚ and in doing so‚ it maximizes the psychological effects of film. “If
you’re not giving up control to the movie‚” Holland says, “you’re getting a
thinned-out movie experience.” More control might be more convenient‚ but it
won’t mean more magic. Surely we deserve better than that‚ and Frodo does
too.

Maximizing the Magic of Movies
The best environment to watch movies is in the theater; cinemas are designed to
maximize the psychological effects of film. But if you’re watching at home, try out
these simple tips to make your viewing experience richer and more fun.
• TURN THE LIGHTS OFF. Remove all sensory information except the lights
from the screen. Your brain’s attentional system, the part that directs what
we pay attention to, will be drawn deeper into the world of the movie.
• REMOVE DISTRACTIONS. Turn off your phone and clear the clutter from
your coffee table. Your brain’s ability to suspend disbelief will be
increased if there’s nothing drawing attention away from the screen.
• DON’T TALK. When you talk during a movie—especially when you analyze
what’s happening—you’re reminding your brain that what you’re
watching isn’t real, reducing the movie’s believability and emotional impact.
• TURN THE SOUND UP. Onscreen sounds are an important way film
makers direct our attention and keep us engaged with the movie. Music is
important too: noises and soundtracks affect us emotionally, intensifying
the viewing experience.
