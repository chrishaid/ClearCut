New York State administered the English Language Arts Tests in
April 2021 and is now making the questions from Session 1 of these tests
available for review and use. Only Session 1 was required in 2021.New York State Testing Program

Released Questions from 2021 Tests
Background
In 2013, New York State (NYS) began administering tests designed to assess student performance in
accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P–12
Learning Standards in English Language Arts (ELA). To help in this transition to new assessments,
the New York State Education Department (NYSED) has been releasing a number of test questions
from the tests that were administered to students across the State in the spring. This year, NYSED
is again releasing 2021 NYS Grades 3–8 English Language Arts and Mathematics test materials for
review, discussion, and use.
In February 2021, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic still forcing restrictions on all educational
and learning activities statewide, NYSED submitted two federal waiver requests related to state
assessment and accountability requirements. The waiver requests addressed the unique
circumstances caused by the pandemic that have resulted in many students receiving some or all
of their instruction remotely.
Later that month, the United States Department of Education (USDE) informed states that it would
not grant a blanket waiver for state assessments. However, the USDE agreed to uncouple state
assessments from the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) accountability requirements so that test
results will be used solely as a measure of student learning. Additionally, it was decided that NYSED
would administer only Session 1 of the Grades 3–8 ELA and Mathematics Tests for the Spring 2021
administration and that the tests would include previously administered questions.
The decision to use previously administered test questions in this extraordinary year was based on
guidance from nationally recognized experts in the assessment field and was recommended in a
publication from the Council of Chief State School Officers to state education departments. Reusing
test questions provided the benefit of having established scale scores and stable item parameters.
Using previously administered test questions also ensured that it will be possible to develop new
test forms for 2022 and beyond. Although it was not the driver of the decision, the reuse of
previously administered test questions provided an opportunity for cost savings during these
unique circumstances where the instructional models used by schools varied throughout the State.
For 2021, the entire Session 1 booklet is being released as this is all that students were required
to take. Additionally, NYSED is providing information about the released passages; the associated
text complexity for each passage; a map that details what learning standards each released
question measures; and the correct response to each question. These released materials will
help students, families, educators, and the public better understand the tests and NYSED’s
expectations for students.
Understanding ELA Questions
Multiple-Choice Questions
Multiple-choice questions are designed to assess the New York State P–12 Learning Standards in
English Language Arts. These questions ask students to analyze different aspects of a given text,
including central idea, style elements, character and plot development, and vocabulary. Almost
all questions, including vocabulary questions, will be answered correctly only if the student
comprehends and makes use of the whole passage.
For multiple-choice questions, students select the correct response from four answer choices.
Multiple- choice questions assess reading standards in a variety of ways. Some ask students to
analyze aspects of text or vocabulary. Many questions require students to combine skills. For
example, questions may ask students to identify a segment of text that best supports the central
idea. To answer these questions correctly, a student must first comprehend the central idea and
then show understanding of how that idea is supported. Questions tend to require more than rote
recall or identification.
New York State P–12 Learning Standards Alignment
The alignment to the New York State P–12 Learning Standards for English Language Arts is intended
to identify the analytic skills necessary to successfully answer each question. The released
questions do not represent the full spectrum of how the standards should be taught and assessed in
the classroom. It should not be assumed that a particular standard will be measured by an
identical question in future assessments. Specific criteria for writing test questions, as well as
additional assessment information, are available at http://www.engageny.org/common-core-
assessments.
2021 Grade 7 ELA Test Text Complexity Metrics
For Released Questions
Selecting high-quality, grade-appropriate passages requires both objective text
complexity metrics and expert judgment. For the Grades 3–8 assessments based on the
New York State P–12 Learning Standards for English Language Arts, both quantitative and
qualitative rubrics are used to determine the complexity of the texts and their appropriate
placement within a grade-level ELA exam.
Quantitative measures of text complexity are used to measure aspects of text complexity
that are difficult for a human reader to evaluate when examining a text. These aspects
include word frequency, word length, sentence length, and text cohesion. These aspects
are efficiently measured by computer programs. While quantitative text complexity
metrics are a helpful start, they are not definitive.
Qualitative measures are a crucial complement to quantitative measures. Using
qualitative measures of text complexity involves making an informed decision about the
difficulty of a text in terms of one or more factors discernible to a human reader applying
trained judgment to the task. To qualitatively determine the complexity of a text,
educators use a rubric composed of five factors; four of these factors are required and
one factor is optional. The required criteria are: meaning, text structure, language
features, and knowledge demands. The optional factor, graphics, is used only if a graphic
appears in the text.
To make the final determination as to whether a text is at grade-level and thus
appropriate to be included on a Grades 3–8 assessment, New York State uses a two-step
review process, which is an industry best-practice. First, all prospective passages undergo
quantitative text complexity analysis using three text complexity measures. If at least two
of the three measures suggest that the passage is grade-appropriate, the passage then
moves to the second step, which is the qualitative review using the text-complexity
rubrics. Only passages that are determined appropriate by at least two of three
quantitative measures of complexity and are determined appropriate by the qualitative
measure of complexity are deemed appropriate for use on the exam.

New York State 2021 Quantitative Text Complexity Chart for Assessment and Curriculum
To determine if a text’s quantitative complexity is at the appropriate grade level, New
York State uses the table below. In cases where a text is excerpted from a large work, only
the complexity of the excerpt that students see on the test is measured, not the large
work, so it is possible that the complexity of a book might be above or below grade level,
but the text used on the assessment is at grade level. Because the measurement of text
complexity is inexact, quantitative measures of complexity are defined by grade band
rather than by individual grade level and then paired with the qualitative review by an
educator.

TIPS FOR TAKING THE TEST
Here are some suggestions to help you do your best:
• Be sure to read all the directions carefully.
• Most questions will make sense only when you read the whole passage. You may read
the passage more than once to answer a question. When a question includes a quotation
from a passage, be sure to keep in mind what you learned from reading the whole
passage. You may need to review both the quotation and the passage in order to answer
the question correctly.
• Read each question carefully and think about the answer before making your choice.
