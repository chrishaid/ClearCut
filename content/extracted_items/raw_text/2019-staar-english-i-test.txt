Candice’s science teacher has asked her to write about an important geographical
region. Read Candice’s paper and think about the revisions that she should make.
When you finish reading, answer the questions that follow.
The Great Barrier Reef
(1) One of nature’s most amazing structures is a maze of islands and coral.
(2) The Great Barrier Reef, an ecosystem of a combined 3,000 coral reefs, sits off the
northeastern coast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean. (3) Located within the much
larger Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the reef is the largest geographical formation
of living organisms in the world. (4) It hosts many types of water habitats, making it
home to diverse marine life. (5) This colorful reef and its many inhabitants create a
spectacular sight. (6) The reef attracts millions of tourists every year. (7) More than
just a pretty place, the Great Barrier Reef provides plentiful sea life to study and
research. (8) The Great Barrier Reef is all of these things to Australia and so much
more.
(9) Although it now covers an area of 135,000 square miles, the Great Barrier
Reef started out much smaller. (10) Many years ago, when a low-lying coastal plain
was flooded by the rising sea, hills were partially submerged and gradually
transformed over time into islands. (11) Intense sunlight flooded the hard island
surfaces found within the shallow waters. (12) These surfaces were prime locations
for small saclike animals called coral polyps to attach themselves. (13) The coral
polyps reproduced and then died, leaving their skeletons behind. (14) Plants, algae,
sand, and small organisms began to fill in the spaces around the leftover materials.
(15) This process created a foundation where a colony of polyps could repeat the
cycle. (16) As the sea and wind continued to bring in new sand and organisms, the
coral reef grew. (17) This reef became a linear chain of multiple coral reefs, creating
a physical barrier that stretches about 1,000 miles along the coast. (18) Bigger than
the Great Wall of China and visible from space, this enormous organism is home to
many other smaller ones.

Page 4
(19) Several types of animals attach themselves to the walls of coral as if the
animals were part of the reef. (20) Marine animals, including protozoa and sea
cucumbers, help secure sand and plant algae to the reef. (21) Sponges and soft
coral living alongside bright red and purple plant algae provide stunning color along
the reef.
(22) The water surrounding the reef is teeming with life as well. (23) Many
animals, such as marine insects and about 500 species of worms, swim in areas near
the reef. (24) Microscopic plankton float freely and help feed many of the aquatic
animals. (25) Larger animals living near the reef include jellyfish, octopuses, and
saltwater crocodiles as well as over 1,600 species of fish, over 20 species of seabirds,
and about 30 species of marine mammals, including dolphins and whales.
(26) Animals large and small live close to the reef.

(27) The Great Barrier Reef provides many environmental and economic
benefits. (28) The coral reefs help protect the other coastline ecosystems, which
include forested floodplains, freshwater wetlands, and lagoon floors, from storms and
erosion. (29) The Great Barrier Reef also provides sources of food for millions of
people and serves as a good home to economically important fish species.
(30) Among these species are salmon, shark, and mackerel that supply commercial
fisheries, big game marlin that fuel sport fishing, and the colorful little clownfish that
attract snorkelers and divers. (31) Humans rely on the coral reefs for food,
recreation, and tourism. (32) The reef’s ecosystem is even explored by researchers
as a possible source of new medicines. (33) Such explorations highlight that these
coral reefs foster some of the most extraordinary underwater systems on the planet.
(34) Because of its global significance, the Great Barrier Reef is classified as
one of the seven wonders of the natural world. (35) In conclusion, the Great Barrier
Reef of Australia is a very cool feature of nature.

Melody feels that students in her high school should start a mentoring program. She
has drafted a persuasive essay that she wants to submit to the school newspaper.
Read Melody’s essay and look for any revisions she should make. Then answer the
questions that follow.
The Case for a Mentoring Program
(1) They are continually telling us that we should become more involved in
the community by volunteering our time. (2) After thinking about this, I have a
suggestion that would not only help high school students get involved but would also
help elementary students in our district. (3) It would be helpful for our high school
to start a mentoring program.
(4) Many of the students at our high school have excellent academic skills.
(5) With a mentoring program, these students could put their skills to use by helping
younger students who are struggling academically. (6) My own sister attends one of
the elementary schools that feeds into our high school. (7) She is having a hard
time in math. (8) Her classroom is crowded, and she can’t always get the
one-on-one attention that she needs to understand a new concept. (9) She has told
me that she has many friends who also need help. (10) A mentoring program in
which high school students tutor elementary school students could be the solution.
(11) By using a mentoring program, struggling youngsters could get the individual
attention they need to master new concepts.
(12) According to an article published in the November 2005 Education World,
elementary school students raised their reading levels significantly in a short period
of time after being tutored by high school students. (13) Furthermore, volunteering
seems to have a positive influence on the high school mentors themselves. (14) As
students learn how to be good mentors, they focus on effective communication skills,
including how to share and how to listen. (15) Generally speaking, these skills are
valuable for everyone. (16) Additionally, mentors get the satisfaction of meaningfully
contributing to their community and future generations. (17) What student, at any
age, wouldn’t be proud to have that kind of influence?
(18) Because mentoring programs have proven to be so successful, they now
exist in schools around the country. (19) Some schools pair high school students
English I
Page 8
with elementary students to practice computer skills, to play sports, to learn to play
a musical instrument, or to discover how to be a good citizen. (20) I propose that
our school begin by setting up a program that focuses on academic tutoring.
(21) Fortunately, starting the program would require only a few students available
and willing to help others. (22) I believe that many students would volunteer to be
mentors, which would help children at all age levels in our school district. (23) Our
high school has an opportunity to allow its students to influence the future today, and
it should do so by starting a mentoring program.

Gabriella’s teacher asked her to write a persuasive paper expressing her thoughts
about owning a pet. Read her paper and think about any corrections she needs to
make. When you finish reading, answer the questions that follow.
Owner’s Best Friend
(1) Last year my family and I adopted a puppy, and it has been the most
rewarding and enjoyable year of my life. (2) I now believe from my own experience
that everyone needs a pet, and I am not alone in this belief. (3) In fact, experts
believe that by spending just 15 minutes with a pet, people can feel more relaxed
and enjoy a restful and peaceful state of mind. (4) Clearly, having a pet is benefitial
and can provide people with a healthier and happier life.
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pets have a
positive influence on people’s emotional well-being. (6) James Griffin, an expert in
child development, says that when children were asked whom they talk to when they
are upset, surprisingly their pet was a common answer. (7) And children are not the
only ones to benefit from pets. (8) Pets can be a source of comfort and
companionship for people of all ages. (9) People feel safe when confiding in their
pets, without being judgmental, a pet will often sit compassionately by its owner’s
side for as long as is needed.
(10) Not all pets are created equal, though. (11) Although goldfish and
parakeets can be entertaining and wonderful pets, those that require more physical
interaction from their owners provide greater health-giving benefits. (12) When
people own a dog, for example, they are provided with many ways to exercise and
stay fit. (13) Since dogs need to be walked and played with throughout the day,
owners are actually exercising without even thinking about it.
(14) Caring for a pet also fosters a strong sense of purpose and belonging in a
person and can reduce stress. (15) As a result, people who own pets have better
heart health and live longer, according to a National Institutes of Health study.
(16) Whether separated from their pets for a few moments or many hours, owners
can’t help but feel needed and accepted when pets greet them enthusiastically.
English I
Page 14
(17) The effects of owning a pet reach beyond the relationship between the
pet and the owner, too. (18) Owning a pet is also a fantastic way for owners within a
community to bond with each other. (19) Walking an attention-grabbing dog will
provide a person with opportunities to meet people and engage in conversation.
(20) Sharing stories about pets creates bonds between neighbors and friends that
can permanently alter their relationships. (21) This is one reason many cities are
opening parks and other public areas that are designated specifically for pets and
their owners.
(22) Perhaps one of the most convincing reasons for owning a pet is that
there is a perfect type of pet for each person. (23) No matter what someone’s
lifestyle or activity level is, there’s an animal friend for everyone. (24) There are 184
different breeds of dogs alone, all with their own unique needs and personalities.
(25) Long-haired breeds, like the Siberian husky, are more suited to life in the North,
while others, like the Chihuahua, are short haired and do better living in the South.
(26) Small dogs that need minimal space are more appropriate, for people who have
a small home or yard. (27) People who are away from home for several hours a day
need a self-sufficient pet, and a cat may be the perfect fit. (28) Even people who
travel for days at a time can enjoy a connection with an aquarium filled with colorful
fish.
(29) Owning a pet can be a rewarding experience unlike any other. (30) As
French poet Anatole France said, “until one has loved an animal, a part of one’s soul
remains unawakened.” (31) No matter what a person’s specific needs or lifestyle
may be, there is a pet just waiting to provide him or her with a bounty of joys and
benefits.

Gena wrote the following essay about an inspiring historical figure. Read Gena’s
essay and think about any corrections she needs to make. When you finish reading,
answer the questions that follow.
Flying to New Heights
(1) A true test of character is not how well a person can avoid obstacles but
how that person reacts when confronted by them. (2) Throughout her life, Elizabeth
“Bessie” Coleman was no stranger to societal challenges. (3) Her unstoppable
courage and will to persevere led her to become one of the first licensed female
pilots in the United States, as well as one of the first licensed African American pilots
in the world.
(4) Coleman was born in 1892 in Atlanta, Texas, during a time when gender
and race greatly influenced which opportunities were available to a person. (5) The
children of slaves, Coleman’s parents were illiterate, limiting how much education
she could get at home. (6) To make matters worse, her school was a one-room
schoolhouse that lacked essential resources. (7) Regardless, these factors did not
stop Coleman from learning. (8) She promised her mother that she would succeed,
consequently she walked the four-mile distance daily between her home and school.
(9) In the years after her eighth-grade education, Coleman went to Oklahoma
to attend Langston University. (10) Unfortunately, her limited funds have run out
after only one year, and she was forced to return home. (11) Afterward Coleman
decided to relocate to Chicago to be near her older brother Walter.
(12) In Chicago, Coleman first heard about the pilots fighting in World War I
and began to think about how she, too, could become a pilot. (13) However,
because Coleman was both a woman and an African American, none of the flight
schools that she contacted in the United States would admit her. (14) A friend then
urged Coleman to go to France to attend a flight school there. (15) Coleman studied
at the Caudron Brothers School of Aviation for seven months.
English I
Page 18
(16) After dedicating herself to her studies abroad, Coleman became the first
African American woman to earn the school’s international pilot’s license. (17) In
September of 1921, Coleman, whom was now a proficient pilot, came back to the
United States. (18) Upon her return, the media went wild for Coleman and labeled
her “a full-fledged aviatrix, the first of her race.”
(19) In 1922, Coleman began to do stunt aviation, amazing audiences with
fearless flying tricks. (20) The public nicknamed her “Brave Bessie” for the ease with
which she completed these feats. (21) But Coleman’s work was not just about
earning money through entertainment; she was also making strides toward gender
and race equality. (22) She refused to perform at places that would not allow African
Americans in the crowd or that required the crowd to be segregated by race.
(23) Coleman relocated to Houston, Texas, in 1925 and began performing
mainly around the southern United States. (24) It was Coleman’s dream to use her
earnings as a stunt pilot to open a school for African Americans, so that they, too,
could study aviation in the United States. (25) Tragically, during a Florida
performance in 1926, Coleman died when her plane experienced a mechanical failure
and crashed.
(26) Although nearly a century has passed since her lifetime, the memory of
Coleman remains strong. (27) In her honor, the Bessie Coleman Aero Club was
established in 1929 to support the careers of African American pilots. (28) Similar, a
group of female African American pilots started the Bessie Coleman Aviators Club in
1977. (29) Then in 1995, the U.S. Postal Service created a Bessie Coleman stamp.
(30) In a statement at the time, the Chicago City Council, which led the movement
for the stamp, expressed that Bessie Coleman “continues to inspire untold thousands
of young persons with her sense of adventure, her positive attitude, and her
determination to succeed.”
Third party trademark U.S. Postal Service® was used in these testing materials.

A Baseball School for BigϣLeague
Dreamers
by Robert Benincasa
All Things Considered, National Public Radio
August 15, 2012
1 If you have ever dreamed of playing big-league baseball, chances are the dream
started to fade sometime in high school.
2 It gradually becomes clear: You won’t be starting in Game 7 of the World Series,
and tipping your cap after hitting a walk-off homer. So at some point you go
from player to fan—watching others chase greatness on the diamond.
3 But not every baseball dreamer is willing to give up so early. And in Bradenton,
Florida, there’s a place that lies somewhere between the Little League field and
Yankee Stadium.
4 It’s 90 degrees and sunny for an intrasquad game, one of the last of the year at
IMG Academies, a private sports school where dreams of baseball glory are
nurtured. Ketchum Marsh, a high school senior from Chatham, Massachusetts,
looks in from third base as a lanky sophomore teammate winds up on the
mound.
5 For Ketch, as he’s known, a passion for baseball began when he was 8 years old,
when his mother offered room and board for some players from college
baseball’s elite Cape Cod League.
6 The players started tossing the ball around with him and soon made him a
batboy. Ketch says they were like big brothers to him. Before long, he says, he
was captivated.
7 He remembers being fascinated by how the players and coaches talked and how
fans reacted to the game. “You kind of just don’t want to leave the field at the
end of the night,” he says. “You want to just keep going back. You just want to
stay there.”
Nurturing Potential
8 So, when Ketch was in the eighth grade, his mother sent him here, where
students spend half the day in the classroom and the other half on the field.
9 IMG baseball chief Ken Bolek says Ketch’s school debut was less than stellar.
10 “There weren’t a lot of things that just came naturally to him as an athlete,”
Bolek says, chuckling. “His first semester here, the coaches evaluated a
successful day by the fact that he wasn’t maimed or killed out on the field from
a lack of proficiency.”
English I
Page 26
11 But four years later, Ketch is bigger and better—5 foot 11 inches and
192 pounds, with massive forearms from his training regimen.
12 Bolek says Ketch has surpassed other players who may have had more athletic
ability but lacked his work ethic.
13 “Ketchum Marsh is one of the most successful stories that will come out of IMG,”
Bolek says, focusing not just on baseball, but on life.
14 Most players here won’t ever put on a big-league uniform, but they come to IMG
trying to find and reach their potential. Virtually all of them want to play college
ball—Division I if they can make it.

15 The pitcher on Ketch’s team, Cameron Varga, is already headed to Division I.
He’ll play for the University of Florida team after he graduates in 2014.
16 His fastball is in the low 90s, big-league heat territory.
17 As the game gets started, Varga strikes out the side in the first inning and trots
to the dugout. Pitching coach Dave Shepard is waiting.
18 “You struck out the side, and I'll give you that,” Shepard tells him, “but as a
starting pitcher you’ve got to know what the emphasis down the road for you is
going to be.”
19 Shepard, who pitched 11 seasons in the minor leagues, says Varga has great
potential. Now, Shepard is trying to set him up for the journey.
20 “[I’m] looking into the future for big things from him,” Shepard says. “He struck
out the side in the first inning, but he threw 20 pitches. As a pitching coach, I’m
looking for him to throw six pitches and get three outs and save 14 pitches for
later.”

Going Deeper Than Baseball
21 Baseball folklore tells us that the scrappiest kid on the sandlot has a shot at
going to “the show.”
22 But IMG is a long way from St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, the Baltimore
orphanage that produced Babe Ruth.1 Tuition, room and board here for the
combined academic and sports program is about $70,000 a year.
23 Along with the price of admission comes the unvarnished truth about one’s
athletic ability and potential.
24 The coaches are positive and encouraging, but they don’t sugarcoat their
opinions. They don’t want to give any player false hope.
25 “We deal with reality on a daily basis,” says baseball chief Bolek. “We are not
sending the message that every one of our players are going to wind up playing
shortstop for the Mets.”
26 And there’s something else: Many of the coaches have given years to the game.
They see beyond young men’s dreams and deeper into their lives.
27 Bolek, who has coached in the minors, the majors and college, says his job is
not always about baseball.
28 “If we do a good job, stressing certain characteristics and traits that are
necessary for anybody leaving here to be successful regardless of what the
volition is, that’s the grand slam for us,” he says.
29 Today’s game ends in a one-run loss for Ketch and Cameron’s team. If these
young players’ dreams come true, it’s just a footnote in a long career in the
national pastime.
30 But the odds are long, even for the very best. Just 1,200 players are drafted
each year, and major league rosters have only 750 active slots. IMG says it’s
had 17 players drafted since 2006.
31 Ketch doesn’t think about the numbers. He pursues his goals a day at a time.
32 “The chances are, you know, there’s not a lot of kids that are going to be
making a living playing this game. If you think about the numbers, the
inspiration won’t always be there.”
33 Whether or not Ketch is destined for Cooperstown, this fall he’ll be doing what
he loves—playing baseball—for the Southwestern University Pirates in
Georgetown, Texas.

I Believe in the Also-Rans
by Clive B.
This I Believe
December 2006
1 I believe in the also-rans.
2 As an English teenager I was schooled in an elite school where I was fed the
idea that I was better than others and that achievement and winning were
all-important. At school I was fortunate to win enough to balance all the times I
lost, and I began to believe in this idea. I survived and thrived.
3 After leaving the sanctuaries of high school and University and going out into
the workplace, I entered that real messy world where my progress was not
measured by an end-of-term exam or validated by my prowess on a sports field.
My life losses began to exceed my successes, and I began to think that there
must be more to life than winning.
4 It wasn’t until I became a parent that this thought became a strongly held
belief.
5 I am the proud father of a seven-year-old girl, Naomi. Her best friends since she
was an infant are two boys, Kean and Cyrus. Until they were old enough to start
school they would play together three full days a week—one day in each child’s
home. Every week I would enjoy the benefit of two days’ child care and one full
day with the three beautiful children.
6 Naomi and Kean have always been fast runners and very evenly matched, too.
Cyrus was slower to develop physically and was nowhere near as speedy as his
two playmates, but he loved to run and play just as much as the other two.
7 One day the three friends were at my house. Our family enjoys a large house
with a great running track. Indoor, wooden, fast with slick speedy
turns—through the living room, past the front door, veer right into the narrow
kitchen avoiding Mom, or more usually Dad, cooking, then a sharp right hairpin
turn into the brightly lit hall, picking up speed as they hurtle back into the living
room to start another circuit or to crash head-first into the soft, cushioned
couch, the finishing line.
8 One day the kids were racing around and I was sitting in the living room as
Naomi and Kean burst into the room neck-and-neck and fell joyfully into the
couch. Each bounced up loudly proclaiming, “I’m first, I’m first.” Several
seconds passed before Cyrus appeared, arms and legs pumping manfully, an
earnest look on his face. He too fell, face first, into the soft upholstery and
bounced to his feet, arms aloft to proclaim, with total joy and celebration, “I’m
third!!”

T. J. has moved from a rural area to a large city. After meeting the narrator and the
narrator’s friends on an abandoned rooftop where they regularly spend time
together, T. J. suggests they make a rooftop garden to grow watermelons. He hopes
the activity will bond them as friends as well as bring a sense of Alabama, where he
had his own acre of farmland, to his new home. The boys have established the
garden after much hard work.

Antaeus
by Borden Deal
1 Then an adult voice said behind us: “What are you boys doing up here?”
2 It startled us, for no one had ever come up here before, in all the time we
had been using the roof of the factory. We jerked around and saw three men
standing near the trap door at the other end of the roof. They weren’t
policemen, or night watchmen, but three men in plump business suits, looking
at us. They walked toward us.
3 “What are you boys doing up here?” the one in the middle said again.
4 We stood still, guilt heavy among us, levied by the tone of voice, and
looked at the three strangers.
5 The men stared at the grass flourishing behind us. “What’s this?” the man
said. “How did this get up here?”
6 “Sure is growing good, ain’t it?” T. J. said conversationally. “We planted it.”
7 The men kept looking at the grass as if they didn’t believe it. It was a thick
carpet over the earth now, a patch of deep greenness startling in the sterile
industrial surroundings.
8 “Yes, sir,” T. J. said proudly. “We toted that earth up here and planted that
grass.” He fluttered the seed catalogue. “And we’re just fixing to plant us some
watermelon.”
9 The man looked at him then, his eyes strange and faraway. “What do you
mean, putting this on the roof of my building?” he said. “Do you want to go to
jail?”
10 T. J. looked shaken. The rest of us went silent, frightened by the authority
of his voice. We had grown up aware of adult authority, of policemen and night
watchmen and teachers, and this man sounded like all the others. But it was a
new thing to T. J.
English I
Page 39
11 “Well, you wasn’t using the roof,” T. J. said. He paused a moment and
added shrewdly, “So we just thought to pretty it up a little bit.”
12 “And sag it so I’d have to rebuild it,” the man said sharply. He turned away,
saying to a man beside him, “See that all that junk is shoveled off by
tomorrow.”
13 “Yes, sir,” the man said.
14 T. J. started forward. “You can’t do that,” he said. “We toted it up here, and
it’s our earth. We planted it and raised it and toted it up here.”
15 The man stared at him coldly. “But it’s my building,” he said. “It’s to be
shoveled off by tomorrow.”
16 “It’s our earth,” T. J. said desperately. “You ain’t got no right!”
17 The men walked on without listening and descended clumsily through the
trap door. T. J. stood looking after them, his body tense with anger, until they
had disappeared. They wouldn’t even argue with him, wouldn’t let him defend
his earth-rights.
18 He turned to us. “We won’t let ‘em do it,” he said fiercely. “We’ll stay up
here all day tomorrow and the day after that, and we won’t let ‘em do it.”
19 We just looked at him. We knew that there was no stopping it. He saw it in
our faces, and his face wavered for a moment before he gripped it into
determination.
20 “They ain’t got no right,” he said. “It’s our earth. It’s our land. Can’t
nobody touch a man’s own land.”
21 We kept on looking at him, listening to the words but knowing that it was
no use. The adult world had descended on us even in our richest dream, and we
knew there was no calculating the adult world, no fighting it, no winning against
it.
22 We started moving slowly toward the parapet and the fire escape, avoiding
a last look at the green beauty of the earth that T. J. had planted for us . . . had
planted deeply in our minds as well as in our experience. We filed slowly over
the edge and down the steps to the plank, T. J. coming last, and all of us could
feel the weight of his grief behind us.
23 “Wait a minute,” he said suddenly, his voice harsh with the effort of calling.
We stopped and turned, held by the tone of his voice, and looked up at him
standing above us on the fire escape.
24 “We can’t stop them?” he said, looking down at us, his face strange in the
dusky light. “There ain’t no way to stop ‘em?”
25 “No,” Blackie said with finality. “They own the building.”
English I
Page 40
26 We stood still for a moment, looking up at T. J., caught into inaction by the
decision working in his face. He stared back at us, and his face was pale and
mean in the poor light.
27 “They ain’t gonna touch my earth,” he said fiercely. “They ain’t gonna lay a
hand on it! Come on.”
28 He turned around and started up the fire escape again, almost running
against the effort of climbing. We followed more slowly, not knowing what he
intended. By the time we reached him, he had seized a board and thrust it into
the soil, scooping it up and flinging it over the parapet into the areaway below.
He straightened and looked us squarely in the face.
29 “They can’t touch it,” he said. “I won’t let ‘em lay a dirty hand on it!”
30 We saw it then. He stooped to his labor again and we followed, the gusts of
his anger moving in frenzied labor among us as we scattered along the edge of
earth, scooping it and throwing it over the parapet, destroying with anger the
growth we had nurtured with such tender care. The soil carried so laboriously
upward to the light and the sun cascaded swiftly into the dark areaway, the
green blades of grass crumpled and twisted in the falling.
31 It took less time than you would think . . . the task of destruction is
infinitely easier than that of creation. We stopped at the end, leaving only a
scattering of loose soil, and when it was finally over, a stillness stood among the
group and over the factory building. We looked down at the bare sterility of
black tar, felt the harsh texture of it under the soles of our shoes, and the anger
had gone out of us, leaving only a sore aching in our minds like over-stretched
muscles.
32 T. J. stood for a moment, his breathing slowing from anger and effort,
caught into the same contemplation of destruction as all of us. He stooped
slowly, finally, and picked up a lonely blade of grass left trampled under our feet
and put it between his teeth, tasting it, sucking the greenness out of it into his
mouth. Then he started walking toward the fire escape, moving before any of us
were ready to move, and disappeared over the edge while we stared after him.

My Desk
by Debora Marsh
I give you my desk,
the white painted maple,
stately, with clean straight lines, three drawers on each side,
the one my father gave to me.
5 He carved his initials in the corner, he said, your great grandfather,
his father, punished him because of it.
He made him fill in the grooves with wood putty,
sand down the wood, and refinish the whole piece.
When he was done, he said it looked good,
10 and that it was a good desk; he used it right through college.
Later, I asked him to do the same, refinish it again,
paint it white to match the 1970s girls bedroom furniture
in the catalog from Sears, so I could put it in my room.
Reluctantly he changed it.
15 He sanded down the finish, erasing the indentations of the letters
and numbers he had etched over time.
When he placed it in my room, white enameled, fresh, like new,
I cried.
So happy to have that heirloom,
20 to have my own piece of history,
to have my own piece of my father.
I sat for hours, make-believing I was a college professor,
bank teller, school teacher, the boss.
I did my algebra homework sitting at that desk.
25 I wrote papers, love letters, and my first poems there.
It has been stripped and painted, broken and glued.
And now, I give it to you.
Older than you by far, it sits in your room
piled high with crayon drawings, coins, trolls, and hot wheels cars.
30 You’re still too young to do algebra homework.
But when you’re ready, and you want to use it as a desk,
together, we’ll strip the finish,
sand the wood,
rub out my etchings
35 and paint it to match your bright green and lavender dreams.
Used with permission.
