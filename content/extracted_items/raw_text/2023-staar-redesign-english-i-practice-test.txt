from The Wild Prince
by Brian Selznick
1 This is my backyard. Over there is the hill where everyone
goes sledding in the winter, and over there is the small yellow
bush, and over there is the big tree that I now know is going
to die in a few years and fall down. The tree will slowly rot
away until the only thing left of it is this memory and the
words written across the paper you are now touching, which
was, of course, made from some other tree that someone else,
somewhere, might be remembering right now. And over there, if
you squint because the sun is in your eyes, is the huge rumbling
air-conditioning unit that cools the entire house. Come and take
a closer look with me. The ground here is muddy and covered in
weeds, and when I first moved into this house I played here in
the dirt.
2 Kneel down in the weeds here. This is exactly where I was
when I found him. I was kneeling, just like you are now, digging
and playing, when I made a most incredible discovery. I thought
at first he was a twig or a strange little rock, but I pulled him
out of the grass and looked at him lying there in the palm of
my hand. I had discovered a tin soldier, the way others before
me had discovered Egyptian tombs and sunken ocean liners.
Who had left this soldier behind? What kid had forgotten him?
The soldier was covered in dirt, and he immediately became my
treasure. I washed him carefully and examined him closely. His
red-painted uniform was faded and scratched, and there was
still a hint of a black mustache on his tiny face. His outstretched
hand was empty. I turned him over and saw that the letters WP
were stamped into his base. His tin hat had faded, and he wore
some kind of backpack that I figured had once been black and
gray.
3 I brought him everywhere with me, keeping him hidden
in my pocket. Sometimes at night I would stare at him, hoping
he would reveal something to me about his past, but he
stood steadfast and silent. This mystery made me feel dizzy
sometimes, and I loved him. I did drawings for him, pictures of
battles that I thought he might like, and I imagined his friends,
all thinking him lost, wishing he were with them again so they
English I
Page 5
could tell stories about the past and laugh and sing. I imagined
my soldier had sacrificed himself for the others, so they could
escape. I was sure my soldier was a hero and a true friend. He
had to be brave to be outside in the tall weeds by himself for so
long, never moving, never shivering, never crying. Even as his
paint faded and his gun was lost, he didn’t lose faith. Maybe he
knew that I’d find him one day. Why be scared when you know
you are going to be saved? I imagined the rain falling on him,
and the snow, and the bugs crawling over him. And still he didn’t
move. Had he been there for weeks? Months? Years? How long
had he waited for me to show up? How had he known I would
come? I didn’t know, but I was glad he waited. I’d never saved
anyone before, and the responsibility was huge.
4 Now look over there, on the other side of my yard, past
the small yellow bush, and you’ll see the edge of a forest that
divides our property from the new development going up across
the way. I was afraid my soldier wouldn’t like being cooped up
in my pocket all day, so I built him a castle. I spent hours and
hours building bridges and turrets and tunnels that snaked in
and out of the ever-growing fortress of twigs at the edge of this
forest. A miniature world rose here, all for my single, lonely,
faded soldier, who had nothing in the world except me.

The Power of Open-Ended Play
1 A small child excitedly unwraps a present while her family
watches and snaps photos as the toy inside is revealed. The
child removes the toy, smiles at it, and then turns her full
attention to the wrapping paper, the box, or maybe even the
ribbon that had bound the gift together. Maybe she puts the box
on her head or ties the ribbon to the leg of a table. This child is
engaging in what educators and child psychologists refer to as
open-ended play. This kind of play is child, rather than adult,
directed and generally uses common objects in interesting
ways. It has no expected outcome of intent. Mounting research
supports that open-ended play is beneficial in sometimes
surprising ways. While it can be difficult to foster open-ended
play in our fast-paced, highly scheduled lives, experts suggest it
is important to try.
Loose Parts
2 Open-ended play starts with the objects children play
with. Electronic toys and toys based on movies and television
shows often steer kids into playing with them in specific ways.
There is typically a right and a wrong way to play a video game.
A character from a movie comes with a premade story line.
Imitating a character from a movie rather than creating a new
one can stifle creativity. Open-ended toys, sometimes referred
to as “loose parts,” give children the room to do something new
and creative. Loose parts could be almost anything, including
blocks, egg cartons, seashells, cardboard boxes, and other
common objects. They are the basis for imaginative play that
helps children become more creative.
Becoming More Creative Adults
3 When a child picks up a stick and imagines that it is a
horse or a telescope, she is exercising the ability to create and
to think for herself. Each step in the process of free play is
valuable. It begins by choosing an object. In the example given,
the child sees the stick. She relates the stick to some other
object. In her imagination the stick transforms into something
else that has its own purpose. This process represents creativity
English I
Page 13
in action. Manufactured toys do not give the mind the same
freedom to imagine as do common objects that do not come
with expectations or history.
4 A child engaged in open-ended play is making more choices
than a child whose play and activities are directed. Learning to
make choices and creating opportunities to succeed in these
choices are essential skills for adults. The Association for
Childhood Education International, in their statement on creative
thought, focused on the importance of having a workforce
of people capable of being more than parts in a machine.
Productive adults can think for themselves, make choices,
and solve problems. Open-ended play supports and develops
problem-solving thinking.
Promoting Physical Health
5 Open-ended play promotes physical development and good
health. This is especially true when children are playing outdoors
where they can run, jump, and climb. Both open-ended and
organized activities can help children become more confident
while developing motor skills and general fitness. However,
open-ended active play also has the advantage of being child
directed. Kids are making the decisions, determining the rules,
and learning to negotiate with their peers.
The Value of Mistakes
6 Obviously, adult-directed activities are more controlled
and more predictable, and often shield children from making
mistakes. Open-ended play allows children to follow their
interests and to make mistakes. With parents playing a more
passive role, children are responsible for these mistakes.
This allows for more chances to solve problems and creates
opportunities for children to be successful, building confidence in
their ability to reason.
The Value of Boredom
7 Kids do not always immediately choose open-ended play
when they are provided with the time for it. Sometimes children
get bored. However, boredom is not necessarily a bad thing—it
can be a useful state of mind. A bored child must think her way
out of boredom. She must observe her surroundings, consider
her options, and then decide for herself what will make her feel
English I
Page 14
better. According to education professor Michael Patte, kids can
learn to find happiness when fighting boredom.
8 The reality of modern life is that much of children’s lives
will be structured. But it does not all have to be, nor should it
be. When parents, teachers, and caregivers take a step back,
they open the door wider for children to create and learn.

The Cowboy’s Home on Wheels
by LeeAnn Blankenship
1 Texas rancher Charles Goodnight had a problem. He
needed skilled cowboys to drive his herd of two thousand
longhorn cattle to New Mexico to be sold. He couldn’t offer high
wages. He couldn’t promise easy jobs or even nice weather. But
he decided that decent, warm meals might entice men to work
for him.
2 In the mid- to late 1800s, cattle drives sometimes took
three to four months, and once the drive began, there were no
stores for hundreds of miles. All the food and supplies needed
for the trip were carried on two-wheeled carts. Usually, the
cowboy’s food was boring and unappetizing.
3 Goodnight went to work and solved the problem. His
invention of a mobile kitchen, the chuck wagon, got its name
from the cowboy word for food, “chuck.”
4 Goodnight took a surplus Army wagon and rebuilt it with
Osage orange, a wood so tough that Indians used it to make
bows. The wagon’s iron axles were stronger than the wooden
ones found on standard wagons, and the wider wheels lasted
longer.
5 At the back of the wagon, Goodnight designed a big
cabinet, called a chuck box, with a number of compartments and
drawers. Cups, plates, eating utensils, flour, sugar, spices, dried
fruit, pinto beans, and a keg for sourdough for biscuits could be
stored separately there. One special drawer, called the possible
drawer, held everything from first-aid supplies to needles and
thread.
6 A hinged lid at the bottom of the chuck box folded down
onto a swinging leg. This made a good worktable for the cook.
The wagon also had a water barrel with a spigot; a toolbox; a
coffee grinder; and a smaller box, the boot, for heavy pots and
pans. Stretched underneath was a large piece of rawhide, the
possum belly, for carrying fuel for fires.
English I
Page 20
7 The wagon also had a canvas top and room not only for
bulky food items but also for extra clothing and bedrolls.
8 The first chuck wagon was an instant success. Eighteen
cowhands joined Goodnight and his partner, Oliver Loving, to
drive the cattle to New Mexico for a handsome profit. The route
they took—later called the Goodnight-Loving Trail—became one
of the most heavily used cattle trails in the Southwest.
9 The chuck wagon soon was the backbone of all successful
cattle drives. Other ranchers created their own moving kitchens,
and eventually the Studebaker Company produced chuck
wagons that sold for $75 to $100 apiece, about [$1,900 to
$2,500] today.
10 The chuck wagon was much more than a mobile kitchen.
Sometimes called “the trail drive’s mother ship,” it was like a
magnet that drew the men together.
11 The wagon and the ground around it were the cowboy’s
home. There he enjoyed hot meals, a warm fire, and good
companionship. He could also get a bandage, a haircut, or horse
liniment for his sore muscles. And there, under the stars and
around the chuck wagon, he crawled into his bedroll each night.
12 Though cowboys took their orders from the trail boss, the
cook was king of the chuck wagon. Usually a retired cowhand,
the cook was the hardest-working member of the trail team.
He was the first up in the morning and the last in bed at night.
Besides making meals, the cook packed and drove the chuck
wagon, doctored sick or injured cowboys, pulled teeth, trimmed
hair, repaired clothing, and settled bets and arguments.
13 Cooks were often grouchy and seemed to enjoy their
reputations for being ill-tempered. It was said, “Crossin’ a cook
is as risky as braidin’ a mule’s tail,” and “Only a fool argues with
a skunk, a mule, or a cook.”
14 A good cook was essential to the drive’s success. One
cowboy recalled, “A camp cook could do more toward making life
pleasant . . . than any other man in the outfit.”
15 A good cook tried to offer a varied menu, even though he
was limited to items that could be stored for weeks at a time.
Cowboys ate plenty of beans, rice, sourdough biscuits, salt
pork, and strong coffee. Dessert was a spoon of molasses, an
English I
Page 21
occasional pie, stewed tomatoes sweetened with sugar, or dried
fruit such as apples, peaches, or prunes.
16 The need for long drives lessened by the 1890s, when
railroads started running through cattle country. By then,
Charles Goodnight’s chuck wagon had found its place in history
and in the hearts of thousands.

The U-S-U Range
A traditional American cowboy ballad
O come cowboys and listen to my song,
I’m in hopes I’ll please you and not keep you long;
I’ll sing you of things you may think strange
About West Texas and the U-S-U range.1
5 You may go to Stamford and there see a man
Who wears a white shirt and is asking for hands;
You may ask him for work and he’ll answer you short,
He will hurry you up, for he wants you to start.
He will put you in a wagon and be off in the rain,
10 You will go up on Tongue River on the U-S-U range.
You will drive up to the ranch and there you will stop.
It’s a little sod house with dirt all on top.
You will ask what it is and they will tell you out plain
That it’s the ranch house on the U-S-U range.
15 You will go in the house and he will begin to explain;
You will see some blankets rolled up on the floor;
You may ask what it is and they will tell you out plain
That it is the bedding on the U-S-U range.
You are up in the morning at the daybreak
20 To eat cold beef and U-S-U steak,
And out to your work no matter if it’s rain,—
And that is the life on the U-S-U range.
1A range is an open region over which cattle, sheep, and other livestock may roam and feed.
English I
Page 22
You work hard all day and come in at night,
And turn your horse loose, for they say it’s all right,
25 And set down to supper and begin to complain
Of the chuck that you eat on the U-S-U range.
The grub that you get is beans and cold rice
And U-S-U steak cooked up very nice;
And if you don’t like that you needn’t complain,
30 For that’s what you get on the U-S-U range.
Now, kind friends, I must leave you, I no longer can remain,
I hope I have pleased you and given you no pain.
But when I am gone, don’t think me strange,
For I have been a cow-puncher2 on the U-S-U range.

Elijah wrote the following paper to present his argument for learning
to play a musical instrument. Read Elijah’s paper and look for
revisions he needs to make. Then answer the questions that follow.
The Benefits of Learning to Play a
Musical Instrument
(1) People play musical instruments to express themselves, to relax,
or even to impress friends and family. (2) As you can see, there are
many reasons to learn to play a musical instrument.
(3) First, learning to play an instrument can significantly speed
up the amount of time it takes an individual to react to a stimulus
or event. (4) According to a study published in the scientific
journal Brain and Cognition, musicians had faster reaction times
than non-musicians. (5) Through years of practice with their
instruments, musicians have trained their mind to respond quickly
to the next note on the page. (6) They have also learned to
continually adjust their playing to blend in with a band or orchestra.
(7) Participating in sports, driving a car, and response to emergency
situations can all benefit from these sharpened reaction times.
(8) Musicians have also been found to have better memory than
non-musicians. (9) Researchers at the Chinese University of Hong
Kong conducted a study. (10) It showed that students who were
involved in their school’s orchestra for one to five years significantly
outperformed students with no musical training when it came to
word recall. (11) The scientists believe that the process of learning
to play an instrument exercises the same region of the brain that
humans use for memory. (12) When people are training to become
musicians, they are also training their memory. (13) But the
benefits of playing an instrument don’t stop with reaction times and
memory. (14) Playing an instrument can also build brain power.
(15) When comparing the brains of amateur musicians, professional
musicians, and non-musicians, researchers found that the amount
of “gray matter” in the brain increases with musical ability. (16) The
study found that professional musicians have the most gray matter,
as reported in The Journal of Neuroscience. (17) Amateur musicians
have the second most amount of gray matter, and non-musicians
have the least. (18) Gray matter gives humans the ability to process

Page 33
information. (19) The amount present in the brain is believed to be
an indicator of intelligence.
(20) While there are many benefits to learning to play an
instrument, some people may never try. (21) One of the main
barriers is the misconception that playing a musical instrument
is too costly. (22) However, there are inexpensive ways to be
introduced to an instrument. (23) For example, students entering
middle school might choose to join their school’s band or orchestra.
(24) Instruments can be borrowed or rented for a nominal fee, and
consistent instruction is free. (25) Furthermore, people today can
find free lessons on the internet for almost any instrument.
(26) When learning a new instrument, some people become sad
at their lack of progress and give up. (27) It is true that learning
something new takes dedication and patience. (28) The rewards,
however, are great for those who persevere. (29) With the right
plan and the appropriate investment of time, anyone can learn to
play an instrument. (30) Those who do will benefit from the process
and develop a skill they can enjoy for many years to come.

Arya wrote this story about a girl who travels with her family to Big
Bend National Park in West Texas. Read Arya’s story and look for
revisions she needs to make. Then answer the questions that follow.
Adventures in Big Bend
(1) When Becca’s parents informed her that the family would be
trekking to Big Bend National Park in West Texas for spring break,
Becca was not excited. (2) The only things she knew about Big
Bend were some things her friend Shayla had told her. (3) It was
in the middle of nowhere, the cell phone reception was spotty, and
there was very little to do. (4) Becca seriously questioned her
parents’ decision-making on this one.
(5) As the family prepared to leave for their trip one early morning,
Becca’s parents’ bubbly enthusiasm contrasted sharply with her
apprehensiveness while they did the necessary things to get ready.
(6) “Cheer up, Rabbit!” her father encouraged, while she grimaced
at the nickname she had had since she was five. (7) Becca had
always loved animals, but one silly encounter with a rabbit in the
backyard had made an enormous impression on her family. (8) Ever
since that day, she had been affectionately known as “Rabbit.”
(9) Becca tossed her bag into the trunk of the car and asked how
long it was going to take to get to the infamous park. (10) When
her mom responded that it would take about five hours, Becca’s
mood soured even more. (11) “Is the scenery at least decent along
the way?” she whined.
(12) “Well, hon,” Becca’s father replied optimistically, “if you enjoy
lengthy stretches of highway in the midst of desert-like landscape,
then yes, it’s phenomenal scenery! (13) But I promise it’ll be
worth it when we get there, because the Chisos Mountains are
breathtaking. (14) I give you my word it will all be worth it.”
(15) Then he added, “I can’t wait for you to get a glimpse of them.”
(16) “Yeah, can’t wait,” Becca replied sarcastically under her breath
as she braced herself for one long, boring car ride and one long,
boring vacation. (17) She climbed reluctantly into the back seat.
(18) She rested her head against a pillow and promptly fell into a
deep slumber.

(19) After hours of tossing and turning in the uncomfortable
confines of the back seat, Becca was startled awake by her mother’s
excited proclamation: “We’re heeeere!” (20) Becca groggily raised
her head and then bolted upright. (21) They were just inside Big
Bend National Park, yet she could’ve sworn her dad had missed
a turn and erroneously navigated to Colorado. (22) Glorious,
tall, colorful mountains surrounded them at every bend as they
meandered down a slow, winding road to the lodge where they
would stay. (23) After rounding a hairpin turn, they confronted an
incredible vista of a deep canyon overshadowed by steep, rocky
cliffs. (24) Gazing wide-eyed into the canyon, Becca suddenly
spotted a large animal crouched on a rock ledge. (25) “Dad, look!”
she yelled.
(26) After a while Becca thought about the opinions her friend
Shayla had shared with her. (27) “Whooooaaa, Rabbit, would you
look at that? (28) You spotted a mountain lion! (29) Amazing.”
(30) The three of them gaped in astonishment at the majestic cat
serenely surveying his domain. (31) Becca could barely speak.
(32) “Uh, Mom, Dad,” Becca finally uttered as the cat slunk off into
some tall brush. (33) “I didn’t know Big Bend was so beautiful or
that mountain lions resided here. (34) I can hardly believe what I
am seeing!”
(35) “Well, Becca,” her dad said, “you have to keep your mind open
to things. (36) You’ll often be surprised!”
(37) “The lodge looks so nice,” Becca’s mom added, “and this will be
a vacation to remember. (38) This park is home to a tremendous
variety of wildlife, including black bears!”
(39) Becca didn’t know how to answer. (40) “Well, what are we
waiting for? (41) Let’s hurry to the lodge and put our things away
so we can start exploring! (42) I’m so excited!”
(43) Becca’s parents smiled knowingly. (44) They had been
confident all along that their Rabbit would feel right at home in this
environment of stunning natural beauty and wildlife.

Rohan is writing a paper to tell about a famous hiking trail. Read
these paragraphs from the body of Rohan’s paper and look for
corrections he needs to make. Then answer the questions that
follow.
Thru-Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail
(1) This rugged hike spans 2,650 miles and goes through
26 national forests and seven national parks. (2) Hikers who
complete the entire trail pass through varied types of wilderness,
including scrubby desert lands, forested hills, and jagged peeks.
(3) As they hike, they experience a range of elevations from just
above sea level to 13,150 feet at the trail’s highest point.
(4) The PCT dates back to 1932. (5) At that time a hiker named
Clinton C. Clarke dreams of linking existing trails to make one
long trail. (6) It would stretch all the way from Mexico to Canada.
(7) Clarke mobilized different groups, including youth scouts and
outdoor clubs. (8) Together they mapped the route and constructed
the trails. (9) The project got a boost when President Lyndon B.
Johnson designated the PCT as one, of two national trails in 1968.
(10) Despite this, the task was so big that the PCT was not officially
completed until 1993.
(11) In recent years the number of thru-hikers on the PCT have
skyrocketed. (12) This may be due to a best-selling book and
subsequent movie in which a woman described her experiences
hiking the trail. (13) More people seem willing to brave the
potential obstacles, which include loneliness, treacherous weather,
and wild-animal encounters.
