from Villages in the Sky
by Ellen Garin
Lost and Found!
1 One December morning in 1888, Richard Wetherill and
his brother-in-law, Charles Mason, were riding along a mesa
in the mountains of southwestern Colorado searching for lost
cattle. Their breath turned to vapor in the cold December
morning air, and the snow on the ground crunched under their
horses’ hooves.
2 The cowboys followed the cattle tracks until they heard
the lowing of their cattle. After they had counted the herd, they
looked around at the spectacular views. As they looked across
the vast canyon, something caught their attention. There,
nestled high up under an overhanging cliff on the other side of
the canyon, was something quite amazing. The cowboys rode
around to the other side of the canyon, dismounted, and climbed
down the cliff on foot to get a closer look. They were about to
make an important discovery.
The Cliff Dwellings at Mesa Verde
3 Wetherill and Mason had discovered a large cliff dwelling
that had been abandoned hundreds of years ago by ancient
Pueblo people. It had been built into an alcove where chunks
of sandstone had fallen off the cliff, creating an overhang. The
overhang protected the cliff dwelling from the weather, which is
why it was intact hundreds of years later.
4 Like apartment houses today, the dwellings were multilevel,
housing many families. People needed to climb up or down
ladders to reach lower and upper levels of the cliff dwellings.
Living areas in the complex were about six by eight feet. Their
ceilings were made of wood planks, and some homes had
colorful wall paintings. The low height of the doorways indicates
that people then were shorter than they are today.
5 Below the living area, and reached only by ladder, was
a round room called a kiva (KEE-vuh), which was used for
ceremonial purposes.

6 The cliff dwellers were clever builders. They constructed
ventilation shafts inside the kivas for fresh air, and each fireplace
had a deflector in front of it that helped to circulate the heat
and the fresh air. The underground kiva stayed at 50 degrees
Fahrenheit year-round. It was cool in the heat of summer, and
only a small fire was needed to keep it warm in winter.
7 The kiva’s roof formed a courtyard above, which was an
area used for working and gathering together. There, women
dried food for storage, wove cloth and baskets, and tanned hides
from the animals the hunters brought home. People gathered
in the courtyard to trade stories while children played and dogs
and turkeys wandered about.
The Ancestral Puebloans
8 For about 700 years, Mesa Verde was a thriving community
of many thousands of Native American people now referred to
as Ancestral Puebloans. These people were master builders,
skilled craftsmen, and adept farmers of a difficult, dry land. They
also traded surplus goods and food with other Native American
communities.

9 The earliest Ancestral Puebloan settlements date back to
the year 600. For most of their time in the Mesa Verde area,
these people lived in houses and farmed on top of the mesa.
Their first villages consisted of homes called pit houses, which
were constructed by digging a shallow pit in the ground. A roof
was made by crossing poles over the top of the pit and then
covering the poles with branches, grass, or tree bark. The walls
of the pit house were often lined with clay or stones.
10 Eventually, the Ancestral Puebloans began building
homes above ground that were constructed of adobe and were
sometimes two or three stories tall. The people farmed the
land on top of the mesa, where they grew crops such as corn,
beans, and squash. The mesa got little rainfall and was not
easy land to farm. However, the farmers were expert in dryland
farming, creating check dams1 and channels to direct rainwater
to their crops.
11 The people gathered wild plants to supplement the food
they grew, and they hunted animals such as rabbits and deer.
They also used turkeys for food, bone for tools, and feathers for
clothing. Dogs were kept as pets and for protection.
1A check dam is a small dam constructed across a drainage ditch or channel to regulate water
flow and limit erosion.

Page 7
12 Then around 1100, these [Ancestral Puebloans] mastered
the art of masonry. During the next hundred years they built
remarkable cliff dwellings such as Cliff Palace. Now the Ancestral
Puebloans no longer lived on top of the mesa. Their homes were
built into the side of the cliff. People had to climb up to the mesa
using footholds and handholds carved into the side of the cliff to
tend their crops or hunt for food.
13 Around 1270, the Ancestral Puebloans left Mesa Verde,
although we are not entirely sure why they left. We do know
that these people settled the area that is now the home of
the modern Pueblo tribes, including the Hopi, Zuni, Acoma,
and Laguna.

Volunteering Is Its Own Reward
1 In his 1961 inaugural address, John F. Kennedy famously
declared, “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what
you can do for your country.” With his introduction of the Peace
Corps later that year, President Kennedy initiated an era of
service and volunteerism that remains as active as ever.
2 Today, dedicated Americans still serve communities
throughout the world as Peace Corps volunteers. What’s more,
over the decades new government-sponsored programs have
emerged that carry on and expand the mission to serve.
AmeriCorps and Senior Corps, for example, have touched the
lives of millions by engaging youth and senior citizens alike
much closer to home, in their own communities.
3 These large-scale government-sponsored programs
typically require a significant time commitment, but there are
also plenty of other opportunities for busy people who still
want to do their part. Charities and civic organizations allow
time-strapped volunteers to help out where they are needed.
Participants can deliver meals to seniors, spend time with dogs
in animal shelters, and visit people in hospitals. They can even
beautify public parks.
4 According to the Corporation for National and Community
Service’s research report Volunteer Growth in America,
volunteerism is on the rise. For people over age 65, the rate
has increased 64 percent since 1974. Perhaps even more
surprisingly, the rate for adults aged 45–64 has increased
almost 30 percent.
5 This dramatic increase, however, raises an interesting
question. At the risk of sounding cynical, what is in it for
the volunteers?
6 For ambitious youth who want to pad their résumés
with good deeds, the answer may seem obvious. The same
could be said for retirees with plenty of time on their hands.
But what about busy adults with families and full-time jobs?
English II
Page 13
Or hardworking students with demanding schedules? Why should
they make time to do unpaid labor? For those already stressed
out and stretched to the limit, why offer to do extra work?
7 The answer, actually, is quite simple. It’s good for you.
Helping others doesn’t build stress—it relieves it. People who
engage in volunteer activities are happier and stay in good
health longer than those who don’t.
8 Stephanie Watson, of Harvard Women’s Health Watch,
argues that volunteering not only delivers mental health benefits
by making people feel socially connected and less lonely, but it
also may help people live longer. “A growing body of evidence,”
she writes, “suggests that people who give their time to others
might also be rewarded with better physical health—including
lower blood pressure and a longer lifespan.”
9 Rodlescia Sneed, who conducted a study in 2013 on
volunteering, notes that volunteering appears to lower stress.
“Many people find volunteer work to be helpful with respect to
stress reduction, and we know that stress is very strongly linked
to health outcomes,” she says. Sneed’s study found a correlation
between doing 200 hours of volunteer work per year and having
lower blood pressure.
10 Studies have also shown a link between helping others
and being happy. A study conducted by the London School
of Economics and published in Social Science and Medicine
found that the more people volunteered, the happier they
were. Compared to people who never volunteered, people who
volunteered once a month were 7 percent more likely to report
being “very happy.” People who volunteered once a week were
16 percent more likely to report being “very happy.”
11 A 2012 study in the journal Health Psychology had a
particularly interesting result. Like other studies, it found
participants who volunteered on a regular basis lived longer.
But what made this study unique was that it examined the
motives of the participants. The participants “who volunteered
for self-oriented reasons” did not live any longer than those
who did not volunteer at all. In other words, to get the health
benefits of volunteering, the volunteers had to be doing it for the
right reasons. They had to be motivated by a genuine desire to
help others and not by a desire to make themselves feel better.
English II
Page 14
12 If this study is to be believed, altruism truly is its own
reward. Paradoxically, the best way to look after number one
may actually be by not trying to look after number one.
13 Volunteering creates connections, builds communities,
and makes everyone involved healthier and happier. It not
only helps those being helped, it helps the helpers as well. By
asking what you can do for others, you may find what you can
do for yourself.

10 In paragraph 12, what does the word Paradoxically mean?
A Improbable but humorous
B Impressive but selfish
C Contradictory yet accurate
D Competent yet inconsistent
59344
11 What is the best summary of the information in paragraphs 1 through 4?
A The Peace Corps served as an inspiration for the AmeriCorps and
Senior Corps programs, which allow volunteers to serve near their
homes. Some volunteers work with senior citizens and hospital
patients. Others work with animals or in outdoor areas. Some
adult age groups are volunteering more today than in 1974.
B Since President John F. Kennedy created the Peace Corps in 1961,
American volunteerism has been widespread. Millions of people
have volunteered in government programs around the world and
throughout the United States. Many people have also volunteered
in local programs run by charities and civic organizations.
Volunteerism rates today show significant increases since
the 1970s.
C The Peace Corps was started by President John F. Kennedy in
1961, and since then volunteerism in the United States has greatly
increased. Americans also continue to volunteer around the world
in the Peace Corps. The Corporation for National and Community
Service has reported that volunteerism for people over age 65
has increased.
D When President John F. Kennedy created the Peace Corps in 1961,
he began an era of volunteerism. Volunteers serve around the
world and throughout the United States. Some volunteer programs
require a large amount of time. Some programs utilize youth and
senior citizens. It is surprising that volunteerism has increased for
middle-aged adults.

Page 16
12 The information in paragraphs 9 through 11 supports which conclusion?
A People who find that volunteering increases their happiness most
likely recruit other volunteers.
B Family members who volunteer together regularly most likely
share the same motives for volunteering.
C Future research studies most likely will focus on how volunteers
deal with stress experienced while volunteering.
D Multiple occurrences of volunteering most likely are needed to
produce health benefits in the volunteer.
59346
13 Which group is most likely the author’s intended audience?
A Skeptical people who are unsure about devoting the time to
be a volunteer
B Generous people who treasure the joy that comes from doing
good deeds
C Selfless people who believe in doing something virtuous with
their lives
D Ambitious people who are eager to look good to potential employers
59356
14 Which statement best expresses the author’s claim about volunteerism?
A People should volunteer in order to help themselves as well
as others.
B Volunteering is a declining American tradition.
C Volunteering their time is a sacrifice more people should make.
D People who volunteer deserve good health.
59350
English II
Page 17
15 What is the most likely reason the author includes contrasting ideas
about stress in paragraph 7?
A To restate a key point more vividly
B To question conflicting evidence
C To emphasize an unusual perspective
D To challenge an opposing viewpoint
59352
16 Which quotation from the article shows that people who volunteer only
to boost their résumés are unlikely to experience increased well-being
as a result?
A For those already stressed out and stretched to the limit, why offer
to do extra work? (paragraph 6)
B Rodlescia Sneed, who conducted a study in 2013 on volunteering,
notes that volunteering appears to lower stress. (paragraph 9)
C Like other studies, it found participants who volunteered on a
regular basis lived longer. (paragraph 11)
D In other words, to get the health benefits of volunteering, the
volunteers had to be doing it for the right reasons. (paragraph 11)
59348

Page 18
17 What effect does the shift in tone between paragraphs 6 and 7 have
on the author’s argument?
A The shift from a doubtful tone in paragraph 6 to a patronizing one
in paragraph 7 undermines the sincerity of the argument.
B The shift from a dubious tone in paragraph 6 to a reassuring one
in paragraph 7 refocuses the direction of the argument.
C The shift from a cynical tone in paragraph 6 to an indignant one in
paragraph 7 strengthens the force of the argument.
D The shift from an analytical tone in paragraph 6 to a self-confident
one in paragraph 7 builds a logical foundation for the argument.

This story takes place in an industrial city of northern Italy in the
early 1950s.
from “The City Lost in the Snow”
by Italo Calvino
translated by William Weaver
1 That morning the silence woke him. Marcovaldo pulled
himself out of bed with the sensation there was something
strange in the air. He couldn’t figure out what time it was,
the light between the slats of the blinds was different from
all other hours of day and night. He opened the window: the
city was gone; it had been replaced by a white sheet of paper.
Narrowing his eyes, he could make out, in the whiteness, some
almost-erased lines, which corresponded to those of the familiar
view: the windows and the roofs and the lamp-posts all around,
but they were lost under all the snow that had settled over them
during the night.
2 “Snow!” Marcovaldo cried to his wife; that is, he meant to
cry, but his voice came out muffled. As it had fallen on lines and
colors and views, the snow had fallen on noises, or rather on the
very possibility of making noise; sounds, in a padded space, did
not vibrate.
3 He went to work on foot; the trams were blocked by the
snow. Along the street, making his own path, he felt free as
he had never felt before. In the city all differences between
sidewalk and street had vanished; vehicles could not pass, and
Marcovaldo, even if he sank up to his thighs at every step and
felt the snow get inside his socks, had become master, free to
walk in the middle of the street, to trample on flower beds, to
cross outside the prescribed lines, to proceed in a zigzag.
4 Streets and avenues stretched out, endless and deserted,
like blanched chasms between mountainous cliffs. There was no
telling whether the city hidden under that mantle was still the
same or whether, in the night, another had taken its place. Who
could say if under those white mounds there were still gasoline
pumps, newsstands, tram stops, or if there were only sack
upon sack of snow? As he walked along, Marcovaldo dreamed of
English II
Page 23
getting lost in a different city: instead, his footsteps were taking
him straight to his everyday place of work, the usual shipping
department, and, once he had crossed the threshold, the worker
was amazed at finding himself among those walls, the same as
ever, as if the change that had cancelled the outside world had
spared only his firm.
5 There, waiting for him, was a shovel, taller than he was.
The department foreman, Signor Viligelmo, handing it to him,
said: “Shoveling the snow off the sidewalk in front of the
building is up to us. To you, that is.” Marcovaldo took the shovel
and went outside again.
6 Shoveling snow is no game, especially on an empty
stomach; but Marcovaldo felt the snow was a friend, an element
that erased the cage of walls which imprisoned his life. And he
set to work with a will, sending great shovelfuls of snow flying
from the sidewalk to the center of the street.
7 The jobless Sigismondo was also filled with gratitude for
the snow, because having enrolled in the ranks of the municipal
snow-shovelers that morning, he now had before him a few days
of guaranteed employment. But this feeling, instead of inspiring
in him vague fantasies like Marcovaldo’s, led him to quite
specific calculations, to determine how many cubic feet of snow
had to be shoveled to clear so many square feet. In other words,
he aimed at impressing the captain of his team; and thus—his
secret ambition—at getting ahead in the world.
8 Now Sigismondo turned, and what did he see? The stretch
of road he had just cleared was being covered again with snow,
by the helter-skelter shoveling of a character panting there on
the sidewalk.

London Snow
by Robert Bridges
When men were all asleep the snow came flying,
In large white flakes falling on the city brown,
Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying,
Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town;
5 Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;
Lazily and incessantly floating down and down:
Silently sifting and veiling road, roof and railing;
Hiding difference, making unevenness even,
Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.
10 All night it fell, and when full inches seven
It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,
Its clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven;
And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness
Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:
15 The eye marvelled—marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;
The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;
No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,
And the busy morning cries came thin and spare.
Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,
20 They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze
Their tongues with tasting, their hands with snowballing;
Or rioted in a drift, plunging up to the knees;
Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,
“O look at the trees!” they cried, “O look at the trees!”
25 With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,
Following along the white deserted way,
A country company long dispersed asunder:
When now already the sun, in pale display
Standing by Paul’s high dome,1 spread forth below
30 His sparkling beams, and awoke the stir of the day.
For now doors open, and war is waged with the snow;
And trains of sombre men, past tale of number,
Tread long brown paths, as toward their toil they go:
But even for them awhile no cares encumber
35 Their minds diverted; the daily word is unspoken,
The daily thoughts of labour and sorrow slumber
At the sight of the beauty that greets them, for the charm
they have broken.

Heike wrote the following paper about an amazing athletic feat. She
would like you to read her paper and look for revisions she needs to
make. Then answer the questions that follow.
Pushing Past Adversity
(1) Swimmers have been both inspired and challenged by the strip
of water known as the English Channel. (2) In fact, this slice of
ocean has been traversed by more than 2,000 swimmers between
England and France. (3) About 40 have swum the channel twice
without stopping, and four individuals have even swum three
consecutive laps of the channel. (4) Sarah Thomas did something
even more remarkable. (5) She is a world-class swimmer who
hoped to set a record.
(6) The swim took 37-year-old Thomas a little more than 54 hours,
which is 2 full days plus another 6 hours of nonstop swimming.
(7) Her accomplishment was even more remarkable because
she is a cancer survivor, having recovered just a year before her
impressive swim. (8) By dedicating the swim to other survivors,
she hoped to be an inspiration. (9) Her determination to overcome
adversity was a critical factor in completing this incredible feat.
(10) Due to weather conditions, swimmers have only a two-week
window in which they can cross the English Channel. (11) But
Thomas wanted to make the journey four times. (12) That made
selecting a time to cross even more difficult. (13) To protect her
skin from the cold, she covered her body in grease. (14) A light was
attached to Thomas’s back so that the support team, who followed
alongside her in a boat, could see her in the dark.
(15) To make sure she had sustenance, the team threw her a bottle
with a liquid mixture inside that gave her energy and kept her
awake. (16) The bottle was attached to a rope, which allowed the
team to retrieve it and refill it. (17) During the trip, Thomas had
to deal with jellyfish stings, mouth and throat pains, and keeping
food down. (18) She wanted to give up at one point, but they
encouraged her to keep going. (19) The most difficult challenge
was still to come, however; it was a surprising shift in the weather.

(20) On the fourth leg of the crossing, the currents pushed Thomas
off the path she had so carefully planned. (21) She wasn’t initially
aware that the currents were causing trouble, but around 3:00 a.m.
one of her crew let her know that she still had another three hours
to go. (22) Her mother and her husband were actually a part of her
crew as well. (23) “I had expected to be done by 3:00 a.m., so it
was a stunning blow,” Thomas later recalled. (24) “However, we had
come that far already, and it never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t
swim until I had solid ground below my feet again.”
(25) Thomas reached solid ground around 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday and
was greeted by a large group of enthusiastic supporters. (26) She
commented that she felt both numb and stunned. (27) The journey
that should have been about 84 miles long turned out to be closer to
134 miles, so after celebrating with chocolate, she said she planned
to sleep for the rest of the day. (28) “I’m pretty tired right now,”
she admitted.
(29) Sarah Thomas accomplished something that had never been
done before. (30) “Swimming a channel is filled with hours of
nothing,” Thomas said, “on moments of incredible.”

France—you have to leave your doubt on the beach in England,”
endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh once said.

member of the International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame.
D “She started swimming when she was just a little tyke but

Julia wrote a story to tell about a girl’s surprise opportunity. Read
Julia’s draft and look for revisions she needs to make. Then answer
the questions that follow.
A Surprise Stop
(1) Art class had always been Natalia’s favorite elective. (2) She
preferred it over theater, music, and even gym. (3) She loved
everything about it—clay, map pencils, markers, papier-mâché—but
painting was her greatest interest.
(4) Natalia’s eighth-grade art teacher had a Georgia O’Keeffe
painting hanging on the wall in her classroom. (5) Natalia admired
it daily and tried to paint flowers that looked similar to O’Keeffe’s.
(6) At home she studied other works by the artist and routinely
marveled at her talent. (7) Natalia was in awe of O’Keeffe’s
paintings of New York and its skyscrapers. (8) The flowers and
landscapes of New Mexico most inspired the teenager. (9) She
worked hard to perfect her paintings, trying to get them to resemble
those of Georgia O’Keeffe.
(10) At the beginning of ninth grade, Natalia’s new art teacher
encouraged each student to create a project of their choice.
(11) Mrs. Rojas said they were free to utilize any materials but
that they needed to make something that highlighted their talent.
(12) Hoping to impress her new teacher, Natalia chose oil paints and
began working diligently to create a piece that reflected her skills.
(13) When the painting was nearly complete, Mrs. Rojas walked by
and said, “That’s quite impressive, Natalia; it looks like an O’Keeffe
piece.” (14) Beaming, Natalia felt the pride swelling up in her heart.
(15) Eventually Natalia took the painting home and proudly hung
it on her bedroom wall. (16) Her parents didn’t seem to be as
impressed as her teacher had been, which was a bit disappointing
to Natalia, but she assumed it was because she already had so
many paintings hanging in her room. (17) In addition to this,
Natalia continued to work on her technique and learn more about
Georgia O’Keeffe.

(18) Summer came, and it was time for Natalia’s family to take
their annual road trip to visit family in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
(19) Early one Saturday morning, Mom, Dad, and Natalia climbed
into the car to start the three-and-a-half-hour journey from their
home in El Paso to Aunt Jackie’s house in Albuquerque. (20) A
little more than two hours into the trip, Natalia settled in for a nap,
hoping they’d be at their destination by the time she woke up.
(21) When she awoke, however, she was confused. (22) Instead,
they were driving through a quaint neighborhood, and before long
she noticed a sign that read “Georgia O’Keeffe Museum.” (23) They
weren’t in Albuquerque! (24) They were in Santa Fe! (25) Finally
Natalia could tell that they weren’t going to Aunt Jackie’s first.
(26) As the trio walked in the front doors of the building, Natalia’s
heart beat with anticipation. (27) Moving through room after room
slowly, paintings hung neatly on white walls. (28) The art that she
had seen only in books was right before her eyes. (29) Looking
closely at each masterpiece, she focused on the detail and tried
to absorb as much as she could. (30) The family spent the entire
afternoon marveling at O’Keeffe’s oil paintings and watercolors.
(31) When it was finally time to leave, Natalia hugged her dad and
thanked him. (32) He had gone an hour out of the way to surprise
Natalia with a visit to her favorite artist’s museum. (33) He had
wanted to surprise his daughter with a special visit. (34) As the
family began the drive toward their original destination, Natalia
reached into her backpack. (35) She pulled out her sketchbook,
newly inspired for her next painting.
