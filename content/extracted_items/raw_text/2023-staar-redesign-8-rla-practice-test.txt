A Day in the Life aboard the
International Space Station1
1 Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live and
work in space?
Eating in Space
2 Imagine going camping for more than a week with several
of your close friends. You would make sure you have plenty of
food and the gear to cook and eat it with. The food would have
to be stored properly and be nonperishable to avoid spoilage.
After finishing your meal, or at the end of your camping trip, you
would then stow all your gear and dispose of your trash properly
just before the ride home.
3 Astronauts basically do the same thing when they go to
space. Preparation varies with the food type. Some foods can be
eaten in their natural forms, such as brownies and fruit. Other
foods require adding water, such as macaroni and cheese or
spaghetti. Of course, an oven is provided in the space station to
heat foods to the proper temperature. There are no refrigerators
in space, so space food must be stored and prepared properly to
avoid spoilage, especially on longer missions.
4 Condiments, such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise,
are provided. Salt and pepper are available but only in a liquid
form. This is because astronauts can’t sprinkle salt and pepper
on their food in space. The salt and pepper would simply float
away. There is a danger they could clog air vents, contaminate
equipment, or get stuck in an astronaut’s eyes, mouth, or nose.
5 Astronauts eat three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and
dinner. Nutritionists ensure the food astronauts eat provides
them with a balanced supply of vitamins and minerals. Calorie
requirements differ for astronauts. For instance, a small woman
would require only about 1,900 calories a day, while a large man
1The International Space Station is a large spacecraft that orbits Earth. It is a temporary home
to astronauts from several countries, who conduct research on the effects of life in space.
Grade 8 RLA
Page 4
would require about 3,200 calories. An astronaut can choose
from many types of foods such as fruits, nuts, peanut butter,
chicken, beef, seafood, candy, brownies, etc. Available drinks
include coffee, tea, orange juice, fruit punches, and lemonade.
6 As on Earth, space food comes in disposable packages.
Astronauts must throw their packages away when they have
finished eating. Some packaging actually prevents food from
flying away. The food packaging is designed to be flexible and
easier to use, as well as to maximize space when stowing or
disposing of food containers.
Sleeping in Space
7 After a long day at work, nothing is better than a good
night’s sleep! Just like on Earth, in space a worker goes to bed
at a certain time, then wakes up and prepares for work again.
There are a few differences, though. Space has no “up” or
“down,” but it does have microgravity. As a result, astronauts
are weightless and can sleep in any orientation. However, they
have to attach themselves so they don’t float around and bump
into something. Space station crews usually sleep in sleeping
bags located in small crew cabins. Each crew cabin is just big
enough for one person.
8 Generally, astronauts are scheduled for eight hours of sleep
at the end of each mission day. Like on Earth, though, they may
wake up in the middle of their sleep period to use the toilet, or
stay up late and look out the window. Different things such as
excitement or motion sickness can disrupt an astronaut’s sleep
pattern. During their sleep period, astronauts have reported
having dreams and nightmares. Some have even reported
snoring in space.
Free Time in Space
9 Living in space is not just all work and no play. Astronauts
like to have fun, too. If you’re staying on the International Space
Station for a few months, it is certainly okay to look out the
window, play with your food, or tease your crewmates once in a
while. Fun is an essential ingredient to the quality of life.
10 Astronauts need a break from their busy schedules when
they are orbiting Earth. Days or even months of straight work
are certain to cause stress among space workers. That is why
Grade 8 RLA
Page 5
6464
flight planners on Earth schedule time each day for astronauts
to relax, exercise, and have some fun. Station crew members
even manage to have fun while working. Experiments in space
sometimes involve ordinary toys and how microgravity
affects them.
11 A popular pastime while orbiting Earth is simply looking
out the window. Inside the International Space Station, crew
members have numerous windows they can look out. Astronauts
often comment on their fascination and awe as they look at
Earth spin beneath them with its multiple shades and textures.
Sunsets and sunrises are also very spectacular, occurring every
45 minutes above Earth’s atmosphere.

Leading Men
1 It’s probably important to explain that Atticus really is
my best friend, although sometimes it can be difficult to tell,
particularly when we are locked in some colossal, overblown
competition.
2 It would be the understatement of the millennium to say
that we are feeling competitive this morning as we arrive at
school. The whole crew strolls in at roughly the same time—
Carson, Atticus, and me, piling into our regular booth in the
cafeteria to wait for classes to start.
3 “Today’s the big day, Saul. Are you ready to see my name
in lights?” Atticus chuckles, patting my shoulder just a bit more
vigorously than necessary. “You remember when Mr. French
said, ‘There are no small parts, only small actors?’ ” I nod and
he continues, “Well, all I can say is I better not get a small part
in this play.” I roll my eyes and Carson laughs, which surprises
me. He’s usually so quiet. Then Carson’s face morphs into a look
of dogged determination. Curious, I think, before turning my
attention back to Atticus.
4 “Sure thing, Atticus,” I say. “We’ll just see whose name is
on the board.”
5 Atticus and I, as well as most of our friends, auditioned
last week for parts in the high school production of the musical
Oliver! Spoiler alert! It’s a play about a boy in England who is
thrown out of a workhouse, experiences misadventures, and
eventually finds a wonderful home.
6 Since the production will be at the high school, Ms. Lopez,
the high school director, came to our middle school to hold
auditions for the kids’ parts. Most of the younger roles are just
parts in the chorus. They sing in group scenes, but they don’t
have many lines. All the adult parts will be played by high school
students.
Grade 8 RLA
Page 11
7 There are a few parts with lines for younger kids. One
interesting character, the Artful Dodger, would be fun to play, but
the part that we all have our eyes on is the lead, Oliver.
8 “Come on, man. You know I always get the best parts.
Remember?” Atticus stands up and lifts his arms in front of his
head, chomping down like a giant pair of jaws.
9 “Seriously, The Carnivore Waltz? That was second grade,
Atticus,” I respond, as that day comes flooding back to me.
10 Do I remember? Of course I remember. Atticus and I had
bolted to the cafeteria after recess, excited to audition for our
first-ever class play. Our teacher told us that everyone would
have a part, but we all wanted to be the mightiest dinosaur,
Tyrannosaurus rex. We took turns performing our interpretation
of a T. rex roar and showing off our best dinosaur moves.
Atticus auditioned last, pushing his elbows into his shirt sleeves
so that he had tiny front arms and stomping ferociously in
circles. I wished I had thought of making my arms look shorter.
When our teacher smiled at his interpretation, my heart dropped
to my stomach. Clearly, Atticus was made to be front and center,
playing the lead.
11 I jolt back to the present when I hear others around me
laughing and cheering as Atticus revives his role from The
Carnivore Waltz. He lumbers around the booths, growling at
everyone while performing a ridiculous dance. Yes, yes, he had
been the Tyrannosaurus rex, and I had been some herbivore
whose name I can’t remember and could never pronounce
correctly. That was a long time ago.
12 Atticus and I always seem to be in direct competition.
Whether it was who got to be line leader in our third-grade
class or who earned a solo in a school production, it was
always Atticus and me, struggling to get the biggest part. The
frustrating thing is that he usually gets it. It’s exasperating! Last
year our drama class presented two theater productions, and he
got the lead role in both. I get parts, but Atticus gets leads.
13 Maybe this time will be different. I feel like I was made for
this part. It’s Oliver, the underdog, the kid who wants just a little
bit more and ends up realizing his dreams. I have talent—I can
sing and act as well as any kid, almost as well as Atticus.
Grade 8 RLA
Page 12

14 Eventually, Atticus quits clowning around and sits down
beside me. “You know I’m joking, right?” he says. “You would
make a perfect Oliver, Saul. I’ll be happy if you get it.”
15 “Thanks, Atticus. You’re right, I would be perfect,” I say
with a smirk. Then I add sincerely, “You would be great too.”
After all the bantering, I am relieved that we can have this
moment. Whatever happens, we will always be friends.
16 The bell rings, and a throng of students moves toward
the door. We are jostling to get ahead, eager to see the page
hanging on the wall outside the auditorium door, the page that
will tell us who got which part.
17 Everyone crowds together, scanning the page. Carson
gasps, and I glance at him and then back at the paper. There it
is, in large print at the top—Oliver: Carson V.
18 Atticus and I finally find our names at the very bottom
of the page with our characters’ names written next to them:
“Boy 3” and “Boy 4.” After a moment of shock, we both start
laughing. Then we turn toward Carson, each of us trying to give
him the first “congratulations!”

10 In paragraph 17, Carson gasps most likely because he is —
A nervous from being crowded by so many students in the hall
B disappointed that his friends received small parts
C excited that his friends get to be in the chorus together
D shocked that he was given the lead role

Avery’s Gift
1 “Everything looks beautiful,” Avery whispered to Danielle as
they waited for others to arrive. Balloons and flowers festooned
the music room, and above the table lavishly laden with cookies
and punch stretched a banner that read, “Happy retirement,
Mrs. Vadakin! We’ll miss you!”
2 But as perfect as everything looked, Avery couldn’t help
feeling beset by doubts. More students began to arrive, and
teachers and parents, and a mass of cards and gifts began to
grow on the table next to the food. Avery held onto the large
manila envelope she’d brought, a viper in her hand, agitated by
thoughts that she should have gotten Mrs. Vadakin something
else.
3 “What’s in the envelope anyway?” asked Danielle, nibbling
a cookie.
4 Avery, embarrassed, replied, “It’s something I wrote for
Mrs. Vadakin.”
5 “Something you wrote, like an essay?”
6 Avery lowered her voice. “Not an essay, a piece of piano
music.”
7 “A composition?” Danielle asked. “I didn’t know you
composed!”
8 Avery looked at the envelope in her hands, hoping it hadn’t
been a mistake, hoping it wasn’t too ridiculous a gift for an
exceptional teacher. Avery didn’t actually write music, but her
father was a professional composer, creating masterpieces for
both film and theater. He was the one who convinced her to try,
arguing an original arrangement was the perfect gift—something
meaningful.
9 So, her father transcribed the piece for her. Note by note,
chord by chord, Avery played her piece repeatedly while he
wrote out the notes, and when they finished several hours later,
Avery was flushed with accomplishment.
Grade 8 RLA
Page 19
10 But now the reservations had returned. Reluctantly, Avery
sidled up to the table and began to slip her envelope into the
mound.
11 Danielle snatched it up, and to Avery’s mortification, called
out “Mrs. Vadakin, Avery has a unique gift for you!”
12 Avery froze while Mrs. Vadakin took the envelope and
opened it, her mouth dropping open in surprise.
13 “Avery, you wrote this yourself?”
14 Avery forced herself to nod.
15 “May I play this right now?” Avery closed her eyes and
wished herself a thousand miles away as Mrs. Vadakin moved
to the piano and settled herself at the bench and everyone
gathered.
16 While Mrs. Vadakin played, Avery’s melody, full of light and
shadows, filled the room. When the final haunting chord hung in
the air, everyone burst into applause. Avery blushed but smiled
back at Mrs. Vadakin, whose eyes glistened with tears.
17 Her father was right: this was the perfect gift.

Chicken of the Sea Is So Wacky—Of
Course It Was Created by Ki
by Samantha Balaban
1 When Ellison Nguyen was 4 years old, he got the chance
to meet Thi Bui, the illustrator of one of his favorite books. He
was so inspired by her work that he promptly wrote and drew
his own picture book—“It came to me,” Ellison, now 6, explains
simply.
2 Chicken of the Sea tells the story of three farm chickens:
Every day they wake up, they lay eggs, they go to sleep . . .
and then they start the process all over again. They’re bored
and ready for an adventure, until one day a rat pirate arrives at
the farm ready to enlist the chickens to sail the high seas (“but
they’re too dumb to be pirates,” Ellison says).
3 The project became a multi-generational collaboration.
Ellison’s dad, Viet Nguyen (who is also very good at writing
books), helped him with the story, and got in touch with Thi Bui
to see if she might like to illustrate it. Bui enlisted her son, Hien
Bui-Stafford, 13, for the job.
Grade 8 RLA

4 “My mom . . . helped me with pointers like the background
or like a posture of the character,” Hien says. “We usually would
work like after school or during the weekends when we had our
time together. Really the whole thing looked really bad without
my mom.”
5 Bui thinks her son is just being modest.
6 “I really was intimidated by the idea of illustrating this
story because it’s way more creative and imaginative than what
I normally do, which is nonfiction,” Bui says. “So I needed Hien’s
brain, which was like closer to Ellison’s brain, to give me the raw
material to work with and so he did all the line drawings on his
own.”
7 Bui says if she had been illustrating this book, she would
have probably “overthought” it—doing lots of research about
chickens. Her son was able to be more intuitive.
8 “Hien just thought: chicken,” she says. “And then he drew
this thing straight out of his imagination and it was spot on.”
9 Viet Nguyen says he loved working with his son Ellison on
the book.
10 “It affirmed for me something that I think a lot of artists
and writers know, which is that it’s really crucial for us to try
to tap into the playfulness that’s inside of us—and the child’s
capacity to think beyond the conventions that we’ve absorbed as
adults,” he says.
Grade 8 RLA
Page 22

11 As for 6-year-old Ellison’s review of working with his dad?
12 “It was great,” he says.
13 When asked what moral he hopes his readers will take
away from Chicken of the Sea, Ellison asks for clarification about
what a “moral” is. Told that it’s an idea people take away after
reading a book, he replies: “Nothing.”
14 So why end the book with a party? Simple: “I like happy
endings,” Ellison says.

The Bears of Kodiak Island
(1) My parents are wildlife photographers, which means that their job
assignments often take us to places where wildlife abounds. (2) We
have been to jungles, forests, mountains, and oceans. (3) Traveling
is not the best way to build relationships with your friends. (4) Still,
I will always remember a trip we took a few years ago because of
the awe-inspiring encounter we had with one of Alaska’s mightiest
creatures—the Kodiak bear.
(5) When my parents told me that I would be going with them to
Kodiak Island, an isolated location in the Gulf of Alaska, I was not
excited. (6) Would we really have to spend two weeks on a remote
island off the coast of Alaska? (7) Did anyone even live there?
(8) Where would we stay? (9) My parents assured me that

(11) A few months later, we traveled to Alaska and then took a ferry
out to Kodiak, also known as Emerald Isle. (12) The strong currents
caused the little boat to bob and weave on the open ocean, but the
landscape was breathtaking. (13) When the lofty emerald peaks of
the island came into view, I stood in awe.
(14) After we got off the ferry and into a rental car for a good place
to turn off the road and look for wildlife, my mother began looking.
(15) “Mom, can’t we check out the lodge first?” I moaned.
(16) “Akim, we’re here to photograph wildlife. (17) That’s our job.
(18) We’ll see plenty of the lodge later,” she said. (19) “James, turn
here,” she continued. (20) “The sign says there’s a viewing area
just ahead.”
(21) Soon we made a stop. (22) The green-blue water was alive
with leaping salmon. (23) As my parents occupied themselves with
adjusting their camera lenses, I heard a loud sploosh! (24) Soon
the culprit revealed itself. (25) A gigantic Kodiak bear, the largest
creature I had ever seen in my life, was in the river just a few yards
away. (26) I froze in fear.
(27) My parents, on the other hand, raised their cameras
enthusiastically and started snapping pictures. (28) Sensing my
distress, my father stopped filming and assured me that the bear
had only one thing on his mind—to eat as many salmon as he could
fit in his belly.
(29) Trusting my father’s judgment, I began to relax. (30) I
watched as the majestic creature battled his way through the rapids.
(31) He would catch and consume one gleaming salmon after
another. (32) I was mesmerized. (33) The combination of the fresh
Alaska air, the towering emerald mountains, the sparkling river, and
the gigantic brown beast left an impression on me that remains to
this day. (34) In fact, that wild experience is the reason I asked my
parents for a camera for my birthday. (35) It’s also the reason I ask
my parents every year if we can return to Kodiak Island to see its
magical bears.

Niko wrote this essay in response to a change of heart he
experienced. Read Niko’s paper and look for revisions he needs to
make. Then answer the questions that follow.
Procrastination and Me
(1) Most people think that procrastination is a negative habit. (2) In
fact, Benjamin Franklin said, “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you
can do today.” (3) But people like me, who routinely put off doing
assignments and chores, are likely to defend our “slower” approach
to getting tasks done. (4) I was in for a surprise when my history
teacher assigned a big project last month. (5) I wasn’t expecting to
learn that too much procrastination really can keep you from doing
your best work.
(6) I’m the only procrastinator in my family. (7) My parents and
sister were all born with the “do it right now” gene. (8) Personally, I
prefer a more relaxed pace.
(9) When my parents expressed concern about my tendencies, I
researched procrastination and found that the behavior is not all
bad. (10) People procrastinate when they need to solve a problem
or commit to a topic or project. (11) In these cases, waiting to
make a decision can be a good thing. (12) This is because our
minds continue to mull over problems even when we are not actively
thinking about them, which can lead to more creative solutions.
(13) My findings made me feel smug. (14) My method for getting
things done was just as good as my sister’s . . . or so I thought.
(15) At school we’d been talking about the colonial days. (16) My
teacher said we would each have a month to build a replica of
a small colony out of any materials we wanted. (17) We were
expected to include things we had learned regarding the lives of
the early colonists. (18) Some worked in the towns, while others
made a living on small farms. (19) The finished projects would be
displayed in the cafeteria.
(20) I thought the assignment sounded really fun. (21) But
November was busy, and I didn’t think about the project much.
(22) Before I knew it, I had only three days left for the project.
(23) In a panic I ransacked our recycle bin, pulling out brown
cardboard boxes, paper towel tubes, and finding paper scraps

that I hastily glued together. (24) The finished result looked like
something my little cousin might have made.
(25) When I entered the cafeteria and saw everyone else’s models
on display, I felt even more unusual about mine. (26) Several of my
classmates had created amazingly detailed colonies. (27) They had
used materials such as clay, wood, and in one case, sugar cubes.
(28) It was obvious that they had put a lot more time into the
assignment than I had.
(29) That day was a bit of a wake-up call for me. (30) I’m still more
relaxed about deadlines than the rest of my family, but something
has changed. (31) Now I tackle things a lot earlier than I would
have in the past. (32) This means I don’t have quite as much time
for drawing and gaming, but the trade-off is worth it. (33) And I
have to admit that it feels pretty good!

Natalia is writing a paper to argue that traditional, printed
newspapers still have value. Read this body paragraph from
Natalia’s paper and look for corrections she needs to make. Then
answer the questions that follow.
The Value of the Printed
Newspaper
(1) There is no substitute for the traditional, printed newspaper.
(2) The bolder and larger Headlines allow readers to find articles of
interest quickly. (3) The content is fixed and does not get modified
throughout the day. (4) This makes it easy to access an article for
a second look. (5) Furthermore, printed newspapers include stories
and details that online versions omit. (6) For example, if a big story
dominates the day’s news; online readers may not see articles about
other events in their city or community. (7) And even though both
news platforms contain advertisements, the ads are easier to ignore
in print. (8) Online newspapers use pop-up ads and stories that
play automatically. (9) Many readers complain that these ads were
distracting, annoying, and intrusive.
