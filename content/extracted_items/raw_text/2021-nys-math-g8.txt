Released Questions from 2021 Tests
Background
In 2013, New York State (NYS) began administering tests designed to assess student performance in
accordance with the instructional shifts and rigor demanded by the new New York State P–12 Learning
Standards in Mathematics. To help in this transition to new assessments, the New York State Education
Department (NYSED) has been releasing an increasing number of test questions from the tests that were
administered to students across the State in the spring. This year, SED is again releasing 2021 NYS
Grades 3–8 English Language Arts and Mathematics test materials for review, discussion, and use.
In February 2021, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic still forcing restrictions on all educational and
learning activities statewide, NYSED submitted two federal waiver requests related to state assessment
and accountability requirements. The waiver requests addressed the unique circumstances caused by the
pandemic that have resulted in many students receiving some or all of their instruction remotely.
Later that month, the United States Department of Education (USDE) informed states that it would not
grant a blanket waiver for state assessments. However, the USDE agreed to uncouple state assessments
from the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) accountability requirements so that test results will be used
solely as a measure of student learning. Additionally, it was decided that NYSED would administer only
Session 1 of the Grades 3–8 ELA and Mathematics Tests for the Spring 2021 administration and that the
tests would include previously administered questions.
The decision to use previously administered test questions in this extraordinary year was based on
guidance from nationally recognized experts in the assessment field and was recommended in a
publication from the Council of Chief State School Officers to state education departments. Reusing test
questions provided the benefit of having established scale scores and stable item parameters. Using
previously administered test questions also ensured that it will be possible to develop new test forms for
2022 and beyond. Although it was not the driver of the decision, the reuse of previously administered test
questions provided an opportunity for cost savings during these unique circumstances where the
instructional models used by schools varied throughout the State.
For 2021, the entire Session 1 booklet is being released as this is all that students were required to take.
Additionally, NYSED is providing a map that details what learning standards each released question
measures, and the correct response to each question. These released materials will help students,
families, educators, and the public better understand the tests and NYSED’s expectations for students.
Understanding Math Questions
Multiple-Choice Questions
Multiple-choice questions are designed to assess the New York State P–12 Learning Standards for
Mathematics. Mathematics multiple-choice questions will be used mainly to assess standard algorithms
and conceptual standards. Multiple-choice questions incorporate both the grade-level standards and the
“Standards for Mathematical Practices.” Many questions are framed within the context of real-world
applications or require students to complete multiple steps. Likewise, many of these questions are linked
to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.
New York State P–12 Learning Standards Alignment
The alignment to the New York State P–12 Learning Standards for Mathematics is intended to identify the
primary analytic skills necessary to successfully answer each question. The released questions do not
represent the full spectrum of the standards assessed on the State tests, nor do they represent the full
spectrum of how the standards should be taught and assessed in the classroom. It should not be assumed
that a particular standard will be measured by an identical question in future assessments. Specific
criteria for writing test questions, as well as additional assessment information, are available at
http://www.engageny.org/common-core-assessments.

TIPS FOR TAKING THE TEST
Here are some suggestions to help you do your best:
• Read each question carefully and think about the answer before making your choice.
• You have been provided with mathematics tools (a ruler, a protractor, and a calculator)
and a reference sheet to use during the test. It is up to you to decide when each tool and
the reference sheet will be helpful. You should use mathematics tools and the reference
sheet whenever you think they will help you to answer the question.
