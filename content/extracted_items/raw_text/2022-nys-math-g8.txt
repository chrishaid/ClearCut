Grades 3–8 Mathematics
Released Questions from 2022 Exams
Background
As in past years, SED is releasing large portions of the 2022 NYS Grades 3–8 English Language Arts
and Mathematics test materials for review, discussion, and use.
For 2022, included in these released materials are at least 75 percent of the test questions that appeared on
the 2022 tests (including all constructed-response questions) that counted toward students’ scores.
Additionally, SED is also providing a map that details what each released question measures and the correct
response to each question. These released materials will help students, families, educators, and the public
better understand the tests and the New York State Education Department’s expectations for students.
Understanding Math Questions
Multiple-Choice Questions
Multiple-choice questions are designed to assess the New York State P–12 Learning Standards
for Mathematics. Mathematics multiple-choice questions will be used mainly to assess standard
algorithms and conceptual standards. Multiple-choice questions incorporate both the grade-level
standards and the “Standards for Mathematical Practices.” Many questions are framed within the
context of real-world applications or require students to complete multiple steps. Likewise, many of these
questions are linked to more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills
and concepts.
Short-Response Questions
Short-response questions require students to complete tasks and show their work. Like multiple-
choice questions, short-response questions will often require multiple steps, the application of multiple
mathematics skills, and real-world applications. Many of the short-response questions will cover conceptual
and application standards.
Extended-Response Questions
Extended-response questions ask students to show their work in completing two or more tasks or a
more extensive problem. Extended-response questions allow students to show their understanding of
mathematical procedures, conceptual understanding, and application. Extended-response questions may also
assess student reasoning and the ability to critique the arguments of others. The scoring rubric for short
and extended constructed-response questions can be found in the grade-level Educator
Guides at http://www.nysed.gov/state-assessment/grades-3-8-ela-and-math-test-manuals.
New York State P–12 Learning Standards Alignment
The alignment(s) to the New York State P–12 Learning Standards for Mathematics is/are intended to
identify the primary analytic skills necessary to successfully answer each question. However, some questions
measure proficiencies described in multiple standards, including a balanced combination of procedure and
conceptual understanding. For example, two-point and three-point constructed-response questions require
students to show an understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and applications.
These Released Questions Do Not Comprise a “Mini Test”
To ensure it is possible to develop future tests, some content must remain secure. This document is not
intended to be representative of the entire test, to show how operational tests look, or to provide information
about how teachers should administer the test; rather, its purpose is to provide an overview of how the
test reflects the demands of the New York State P–12 Learning Standards.
The released questions do not represent the full spectrum of the standards assessed on the State tests, nor
do they represent the full spectrum of how the standards should be taught and assessed in the classroom. It
should not be assumed that a particular standard will be measured by an identical question in future
assessments.

TIPS FOR TAKING THE TEST
Here are some suggestions to help you do your best:
• Read each question carefully and think about the answer before making your choice or
writing your response.
• You have been provided with mathematics tools (a ruler, a protractor, and a calculator)
and a reference sheet to use during the test. It is up to you to decide when each tool and
the reference sheet will be helpful. You should use mathematics tools and the reference
sheet whenever you think they will help you to answer the question.
• Be sure to show your work when asked.
