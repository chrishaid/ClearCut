Overview of Grade 8 Mathematics Test
The spring 2023 grade 8 Mathematics test was a next-generation assessment that was administered in two formats: a computer-
based version and a paper-based version. Most students took the computer-based test. The paper-based test was offered as an
accommodation for eligible students who were unable to use a computer. More information can be found on the MCAS Test
Administration Resources page at www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/admin.html.
Most of the operational items on the grade 8 Mathematics test were the same, regardless of whether a student took the computer-
based version or the paper-based version. In places where a technology-enhanced item was used on the computer-based test, an
adapted version of the item was created for use on the paper test. These adapted paper items were multiple-choice, multiple-select,
or short-answer items that tested the same Mathematics content and assessed the same standard as the technology-enhanced item.
This document displays released items from the paper-based test. Released items from the computer-based test are
available on the MCAS Resource Center website at mcas.pearsonsupport.com/released-items.
Test Sessions and Content Overview
The grade 8 Mathematics test was made up of two separate test sessions. Each session included selected-response, short-
answer, and constructed-response questions. On the paper-based test, the selected-response questions were multiple-choice
items and multiple-select items, in which students select the correct answer(s) from among several answer options.
Standards and Reporting Categories
The grade 8 Mathematics test was based on standards in the five domains for grade 8 in the Massachusetts Curriculum
Framework for Mathematics (2017). The five domains are listed below.
• The Number System
• Expressions and Equations
• Functions
• Geometry
• Statistics and Probability
The Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for Mathematics is available on the Department website at
www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/current.html.
Mathematics test results are reported under four MCAS reporting categories, which are based on the five framework domains
listed above.
The tables at the conclusion of this document provide the following information about each released and unreleased operational
item: reporting category, standard(s) covered, item type, and item description. The correct answers for released selected-
response and short-answer questions are also displayed in the released item table.
Reference Materials and Tools
Each student taking the paper-based version of the grade 8 Mathematics test was provided with a plastic ruler and a grade 8
Mathematics Reference Sheet. A copy of the reference sheet follows the final question in this document. An image of the ruler
is not reproduced in the document.
During Session 2, each student had sole access to a calculator. Calculator use was not allowed during Session 1.
During both Mathematics test sessions, the use of bilingual word-to-word dictionaries was allowed for current and former
English learner students only. No other reference tools or materials were allowed.

Grade 8 Mathematics
SESSION 1
This session contains 10 questions.
You may use your reference sheet during this session.
You may not use a calculator during this session.
Directions
Read each question carefully and then answer it as well as you can. You must record
all answers in this Test & Answer Booklet.
For some questions, you will mark your answers by filling in the circles in your
Test & Answer Booklet. Make sure you darken the circles completely. Do not make
any marks outside of the circles. If you need to change an answer, be sure to erase
your first answer completely.
For other questions, you will need to fill in an answer grid. Directions for completing
questions with answer grids are provided on the next page.
If a question asks you to show or explain your work, you must do so to receive full
credit. Write your response in the space provided. Only responses written within the
provided space will be scored.
Mathematics Session 13
Directions for Completing Questions with Answer Grids
1. Work the question and find an answer.
2. Enter your answer in the answer boxes at the top of the answer grid.
3. Print only one number or symbol in each box. Do not leave a blank box in
the middle of an answer.
4. Under each answer box, fill in the circle that matches the number or
symbol you wrote above. Make a solid mark that completely fills the circle.
5. Do not fill in a circle under an unused answer box.
6. Fractions cannot be entered into an answer grid and will not be scored.
Enter fractions as decimals.
7. If you need to change an answer, be sure to erase your first answer
completely.
8. See below for examples of how to correctly complete an answer grid.
