Grades 3–8 Mathematics
Released Questions from 2023 Exams
Background
As in past years, SED is releasing large portions of the 2023 NYS Grades 3–8 English Language Arts and
Mathematics test materials for review, discussion, and use.
For 2023, included in these released materials are at least 75 percent of the test questions that appeared on
the 2023 tests (including all constructed-response questions) that counted toward students’ scores.
Additionally, SED is also providing a map that details what each released question measures and the correct
response to each question. These released materials will help students, families, educators, and the public
better understand the tests and the New York State Education Department’s expectations for students.
Understanding Math Questions
Multiple-Choice Questions
Multiple-choice questions are designed to assess the New York State P–12 Next Generation Learning
Standards for Mathematics. Mathematics multiple-choice questions will be used mainly to assess standard
algorithms and conceptual standards. Multiple-choice questions incorporate both the grade-level standards
and the “Standards for Mathematical Practices.” Many questions are framed within the context of real-world
applications or require students to complete multiple steps. Likewise, many of these questions are linked to
more than one standard, drawing on the simultaneous application of multiple skills and concepts.
One-Credit Constructed-Response Questions
One-credit constructed-response questions require students to complete a task and provide only their final
answer. These one-credit questions will often require multiple steps, assessing procedural skills, as well as
conceptual understanding and application. While students may show how they arrived at their final answer,
only the final answer will be scored.
Two-Credit Constructed-Response Questions
Two-credit constructed-response questions require students to complete tasks and show their work. These
two-credit response questions will often require multiple steps, the application of multiple mathematics
skills, and real-world applications. Many of the short-response questions will cover conceptual and
application standards.
Three-Credit Constructed-Response Questions
Three-credit constructed-response questions ask students to show their work in completing two or more
tasks or a more extensive problem. These three-credit response questions allow students to show their
understanding of mathematical procedures, conceptual understanding, and application. Three-credit
response questions may also assess student reasoning and the ability to critique the arguments of others. The
scoring rubric for all constructed-response questions can be found in the grade-level Educator Guides at
http://www.nysed.gov/state-assessment/grades-3-8-ela-and-math-test-manuals.
New York State P–12 Next Generation Learning Standards Alignment
The alignment(s) to the New York State P–12 Next Generation Learning Standards for Mathematics is/are
intended to identify the primary analytic skills necessary to successfully answer each question. However,
some questions measure proficiencies described in multiple standards, including a balanced combination of
procedure and conceptual understanding. For example, two-credit and three-credit constructed-response
questions require students to show an understanding of mathematical procedures, concepts, and
applications.
These Released Questions Do Not Comprise a “Mini Test”
To ensure it is possible to develop future tests, some content must remain secure. This document is not
intended to be representative of the entire test, to show how operational tests look, or to provide
information about how teachers should administer the test; rather, its purpose is to provide an overview of
how the test reflects the demands of the New York State P–12 Next Generation Learning Standards.
The released questions do not represent the full spectrum of the standards assessed on the State tests, nor
do they represent the full spectrum of how the standards should be taught and assessed in the classroom. It
should not be assumed that a particular standard will be measured by an identical question in future
assessments.

TIPS FOR TAKING THE TEST
Here are some suggestions to help you do your best:
• Read each question carefully and think about the answer before making your choice.
• You have been provided with mathematics tools (a ruler, a protractor, and a calculator)
and a reference sheet to use during the test. It is up to you to decide when each tool and
the reference sheet will be helpful. You should use mathematics tools and the reference
sheet whenever you think they will help you to answer the question.
